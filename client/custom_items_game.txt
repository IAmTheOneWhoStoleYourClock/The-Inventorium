//
// Welcome to the end of the world and my mind!
// In all seriousness, though, this is going to get messy.
// In order for your silly little client to understand what's going on, all of these need to be in one file. (I think)
// To enable these for private use, just take these files from your downloads folder and put them in your custom folder (i think) you'll need to put it in a new folder for the game to not explode though.
// If you want a "pure" download, download it from github here: 
// If you're here to see how your favourite weapon operates under the hood, buckle up cause you're in for a ride.
// If you're one of the developers that made these packs, double check you're strapped in cause it's going to likely be even worse for you to see how i've butchered your babies. (I jest. Mostly.)
// These packs are up to date as of 31/03/2025, with the exception of ReValve, because I already implented most of the updates changes anyways.
// If you are a weapon maker or modeler featured in this pack and would like to have your models/weapons removed, contact me on discord (@clockstealer) or make an issue on the github page.
// Also, apologies for the poor grammar in advance. -Clock
// For client only. Don't worry, there's litterally only 2 changes to the ham shank so it looks nicer. -Clock

//-------------------------------------------------------------------// For some sense of convenience, I'll try to keep my weapons up in the 3300-4500 ID range. Higher than that, I won't touch - feel free to use those for your own stuff!
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// FUNCTIONALLY though, I should only need like, 3300-4000. 8+ Updates later, and I've only barely scratched up to using maybe 300 total. Still, from now on, I'll do my best to keep in this range. You have my word.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// I'm unsure how other Weapons Packs want to handle it, but having all of our stuff cordoned off into copy-and-pasteable chunks might help quite a bit!
//-- NEW-OLD WEAPONS PACK ITEMS AREA (3300 - 4500)-------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Also, if you're wondering why such a specific number; TF2C v2.0.0 Release had its unlockable items all the way up at about the 3000 range. I figured I'd start mine at 3300 to be safe.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That's enough for the 10 classes to get 10 official weapons in EVERY weapon slot, including PDAs! Needless to say, that's far more than even Live TF2 ever had (not counting reskins).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Granted, later they reverted to having the new items be in the low 32-50's range, so that left a huge amount of space in-between. I'm not moving my weapons closer, so if you want anything that shows up BEFORE my stuff - try there!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v1.0.0 (Update 1, 7/30/2020)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Yakibomb (Crusader's Crossbow)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 40 Weapons! (13:27 New/Old)]
//
// And so, my humble weapons mod turns a new leaf and begins a new stage on its journey! Old friends and subscribers of mine might remember a time a decade ago when I was making all sorts of strange weapons for TF2C's v2.0.0 B4! It was fun then, and my hope is that it'll be fun now!
// In this first update, you'll find many returning items, both from my old projects as well as from regular TF2, and even TF2C's scrapped ideas, but I've made sure to include plenty of brand new toys to play with, too!
// Hopefully, your backpack doesn't feel so bare anymore, haha! I only plan to add more, as I get the ideas, so keep an eye out! And, hopefully, you'll have fun using this all these new weapons to maim eachother with! Have fun!

//-----
// [Authors: Valve (Assets, "Team Fortress 2" https://store.steampowered.com/app/440) | Crowbar Collective (Sounds, "Black Mesa" https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890)]
// [Overview: A Stock Reskin with HL1 flair! Unremarkable as a starting weapon goes.]
//
// In a way, beside literally being the first weapon here, the Crowbar might well be one of my first custom weapons... ever. Its story goes all the way back to the infancy of TF2C, back when the game was little more than 2007 TF2 with a Nailgun.
// I had found an SFM Crowbar in Meet the Medic's files, and wanted to make that a weapon, so I did! I kept pushing for it to be an all-class weapon like in TFC on FP Forums, but kept getting rebuffed. However, it eventually made it onto Mercenary!!
// ...who was later taken away by Class Protective Services. Whee. But, long story short, that meant I was free to just, add it back in, as a REAL all-class item, when the time came to finally make my own bundle of stuff!
//
// Other Notes:
// Since this is the very first weapon, I'll go into detail what tends to go into ANY given custom weapon!
// If you're curious about it, take a gander, otherwise feel free to skim onto the other things further down! Have fun~
// Things marked with [!] are important to have in some form no matter what, so pay extra attention to those!
//--------------------------------------------------
		"3300" 																					// [Item ID] 			[!] A unique number ID for this specific weapon! Every wpn (& variants) can only use one ID number each, so make sure you don't re-use any numbers! Most of my stuff hangs out in the 3300's and above.
		{
			"name"						"TF_WEAPON_CROWBAR"										// [Internal Name] 		- A name for some backend stuff! Set this to anything, or leave it out entirely if you like. Rarely has any effect, but sometimes gets used by Response Rules, if you mess with those.
			"prefab"					"weapon_bat"											// [Prefab] 			- A Prefab is a set of basic, predefined info - like what base weapon it is, or what classes use it - if you're making a variant of an existing weapon. Use these to save time - or set info manually if you wish! This mod has no custom prefabs, so look for examples in regular items_game.txt!
			"item_class"				"tf_weapon_bat"											// [Item Class] 		[!] What item_class is this using as a base, for basic weapon functions! Most base weapons in TF2 have useful properties, so experiment. For many of these keyvalues, these are already defined in a prefab, if using one.
			"item_slot"					"melee"													// [Item Slot]			[!] What loadout slot is this equipped in? Probably a good idea to set this, if the prefab doesn't! Note, somewhat weird behavior can result if you try to put an item in a different slot than it usually is, I won't cover that here!
			"anim_slot"					"melee"													// [Anim. Set]			- What animation set does it use in-game? This isn't needed most of the time, but can be helpful for unique weapons that use different animations (like a Secondary using Primary animations)
			"show_in_armory"			"1"														// [Show in Loadout] 	[!] VERY important for any weapon! Essentially, does it show up in your Loadout to select? This should always be enabled on any weapon you ever make!!

			"image_inventory_size_w"	"128"													// [BP Image Size]		[!] These are only useful if you AREN'T using a prefab, this just tells TF2 how wide and tall a BP image is! It freaks out if no info's defined, fun.
			"image_inventory_size_h"	"82"

			"propername"				"0"														// [Is a Proper-Name?]	- If enabled, adds the prefix "The " (or localized variant) to an item's name! As a quick rule, say "a Crowbar" or "the Crowbar" aloud; if it seems like there's multiple in any base and the name is just what it is, leave this disabled. If it seems singular, custom-made, or like its name is a "Product Name", then enable this!
			"item_name_color"			"204 204 250 255"										// [Name Color]			- A custom color for the item's name! You can use it as a stand-in for unique item rarities, if you like. The format is RGBA, and the last number is always 255 unless you're weird!
			"item_name"					"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Name]			[!] The display name of the item! This accepts plaintext, but #TF_Localization is nice if present! You can put fake-prefix words at the start of a name to stand-in for modifiers like new rarities, or stuff like killstreak or strange indicators!
			"item_type_name"			"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Type]			- What kind of generic object is this? Be concise! Use terms like "Rifle" or "Fire Extinguisher", and only add extra descriptive adjectives if it's absolutely nessecary!
			"item_description"			"Good for bashing a chucklehead's skull in."			// [Description] 		[!] A description box! Explain extra weapon functions, include short quotes, or just leave helpful info! Use TF2C's descriptions as a style-guide - you can mimic quotes by doing 'this' or “this”, and you can include linebreaks by making a new line in your text editor! You can see some examples below.
			"item_logname"				"crowbar"												// [Console Log Name]	- What it's called when referred to in Dev. Console's killfeed. This doesn't really do much, but it's good practice to have this be the same as the actual kill-icon name.
			"item_iconname"				"crowbar"												// [Kill-Icon]			[!] A kill-icon sprite to use, from mod_textures.txt! Adding new kill-icons is a long process, so you can leave this out, and it'll use the default kill-icon for the type of weapon you're using anyway!
			"image_inventory"			"backpack/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar"					// [Backpack Icon]		[!] A Backpack icon, used for your Loadout! Important note; TF2C automatically adds "_large.vmt" to the filename and tries loading that, so ".../w_crowbar" actually looks for ".../w_crowbar_large.vmt"! Keep this in mind...
			"model_world"				"models/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [World Model]		[!] A weapon's w_model - used for holding the weapon on your playermodel. You can often use Live TF2 c_models as w_models, but TF2C adds many new features, so be mindful!!
			"model_player"				"models/weapons/v_models/v_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [C / View Model]		[!] A weapon's v_model, or c_model! TF2C viewmodels are a weapon model and viewmodel anims on the same model, and that's it. Class arms are attached on afterward, so decompile a few v_models and mess around!
			"attach_to_hands"			"2"														// [Use w/v, or c?]		[!] How should this weapon use its models? Set this to "1" for Live TF2 c_models, or "2" for TF2C w/v_models. Most TF2C weapons SHOULD be "2", for the extra versatility allowed.
			"used_by_classes"																	// [Used by Class]		[!] Who's able to equip this? For a class that can equip this, it shows up in whatever loadout slot you input earlier. For multi-class weapons, you can set a slot, like "primary" instead of "1", to have that class get it in a different slot!
			{
				"scout"					"1"
			}
			"static_attrs"																		// [Simple Stats]		- Shortened weapon stats / attribs! If you're confident in your abilities, or want to add stats quickly, all this needs is an attribute name and a value, and it'll give you a working stat!

			}
			"attributes"																		// [Weapon Stats]		- Weapon stats / attributes! A weapon stat is made up of 3 main parts - its "name", its "function", and a "value".
			{
				"noise damage"																	// A stat "name" defines what text shows up to describe what a stat does, as well as how to handle numbers given by "value" - is it toggled, or flat add / subtracted ("additive")?, or multiplied / divided - ("percentage")?
				{
					"attribute_class"	"DISPLAY_ONLY"											// A stat "function" is what a stat actually does, influenced slightly by how numbers are handled by "name"! An empty or invalid function field, like here, means it does nothing - useful for text you just want to show and never do anything else.
					"value"				"25"													// A stat "value", lastly, is a modifier for whatever your stat actually does. Depending on if this is read as "additive" or "percentage" by the name field from earlier, you may need to change this!

// You know it, you love it - the Frying Pan returns! To be entirely honest with you, this weapon did take a while to appear. Part of the way through the planning phases of the first update, I just, wanted to hit someone with a Frying Pan.
// Of course, given the only weapons back then were the Crowbar, AA Gun, and maybe FAN or Shortstop, I had plenty of room to bring back the Accursed Weapon! And it's certainly nice to have, even if it doesn't really do anything, ha...

// (ID 3320~3329) |	Conscientious Objector		|	Tags: (v1.7.5), (Old), (AllClass), (Melee), (Utility), (Weapon)							|	Extra: (Scout), (Soldier), (Pyro), (Demoman), (Heavy), (Engineer), (Medic), (Sniper), (Spy), (Civilian)
//-----
// [Authors: Valve (Assets, "Team Fortress 2" https://store.steampowered.com/app/440)]
// [Overview: A Stock Reskin, but with very slightly extra poking range.]
//
// A strange weapon to bring back, but it came from a place of (trying) to implement having your own spray as a decal on the weapon! Failing that, of course, I ended up making an entire "custom decal" system just for it...
// That aside though, it's certainly a strange weapon. Later on, I gave it very slightly longer range, as a sort of option for classes that don't natively have a longer-range weapon! Not... super, interesting, but it's fine. Maybe...
// This was largely for everyone except for Spy, who had... unique, problems. Accordingly, the range is a lot smaller for his Objector, and he later got a surprise inclusion...!
//
// Other Notes:
// Original Weapon ID was (3390 ~ 3399). Moved to AllClass Reskins section.
// If you want to use custom decals, extract "custom_objector_decals_go_here!" from the Mod Install into your custom folder, and edit the "decal_team.vtf" files within! More details in a text file there.

// [Overview: Scout - A Pistol with excellent mid-range burst damage! Less stopping power than your other options.]
//
// The first actual weapon! Let's get crackin'! I decided I wanted to bring the Shortstop back, first, since Scout has really been missing... much of anything to use. And, since I've already made this once before in my old videos, this is a natural next-step!
// Though... not without some growing pains along the way, unfortunately. Given how... uniquely, scuffed this weapon is, it swapped back and forth between being based on a Pistol, then a Revolver, then Nailgun, and finally just, no bullshit, just a Scattergun.
// And, as far as how it works, it's just a very no-shenanigans version of Live's Shortstop (the old one), just a good mid-range option in your usually close-range toolkit. Importantly, with the old reload speed, and even some of the new perks! No shove, though. You've got another gun for that!

// [Overview: Scout - A Shotgun that provides increased mobility and disrupts enemy movement!]
//
// A two-parter for my old, returning weapons, is Scout's iconic double-barrel scattergun with more recoil than he or the enemy can handle, the Force-a-Nature! I've always really, really liked the way it felt to fire this gun, so naturally I wanted to bring it back ASAP, too!
// At first, though, all it had to its name was the damage-dealing parts. No knockback, whatsoever. It made it a bit disappointing to shoot and not get any mobility or enemy-bothering ability out of it, but luckily, both of these got added back with future TF2C updates, so it finally works as intended!
// With surprisingly little fuss, too - the original really already is a heavily-mangled scattergun. So, for better or worse, your favorite neighborhood double-barrel is back in town to send dumbasses off cliffs and you to the safe clutches of the nearest medkit! As it was meant to be.

// Ah, memories. This was one of the very first weapons I ever added, and starry-eyed me wanted to have it be an incendiary shotgun that lit people on fire! I always liked that, but it proved... troublesome. Very, very troublesome.
// There's the obvious issue of hitscan afterburn being difficult to play against, but also no such thing as "afterburn duration with distance" exists, so... painfully, I had to cut that functionality out. So, I wanted to try another rework.

// "Why get your hands dirty, when you could just let your folks tear 'em apart like dingos?" - if that's the kinda thinking you aspire by, then this rifle is for you! Stand from afar and help your team out!
// As one of the first rifles I made, and especially given Sniper's already-existing offense-focused arsenel, I wanted to go for a faster-firing, weaker rifle for support purposes. At first, this was just a simple MfD, but over time, it shifted to outlines, then both, then...
// Well, we'll see where it goes. I think I want to keep the outline, but the exact nitty-gritty may change over time!
//--------------------------------------------------
		"3363"																					// The idea with this weapon was to make a "support" Sniper Rifle - where instead of picking off key targets, Sniper "marks" key targets for nearby teammates to go after. The most experimental of the bunch, so this might change in the future.

// [Overview: Soldier - A Melee that boosts speed for both yourself and allies! Worse at combat.]
//
// Well? You aren't being paid to stand around, get yourself and your lackadaisical team MOVING, SOLDIER!! This weapon was an interesting challenge to bring into TF2C, considering how relatively unique its effect of speedboosting even worked!
// I wanted to tackle it being a variant of the Umbrella, for Soldier; it makes a single ally at a time faster! And, as of writing, yourself too! Sadly, can't really modify the cooldowns, but it is what it is.
// While I'm fairly happy with this interpretation, if they ever add proper addcond on ally hit stuff, then I'll most likely split this! And, Civ may have a new toy on the horizon... only if.

// FINALLY! A Revolver! I've been meaning to tackle a new Revolver for a while, so why not one of Spy's baguette-et-buerre tools, the ol' snubnosed Enforcer! This weapon from the very start has been a more damage-centric tool, but over time it evolved.
// Initially, it was just unconditional damage, both here and in Live. Scary, and Spy doesn't lose that much for it, either. Now, though, it only does more for a single shot that also breaks your disguise. Hey, but it is the most reliable tool for dealing with resist-buffed enemies!

// An odd inclusion, but the strange spikewrench is here...! Originally, it started as a test for a "Nail Sentry" wrench - before I really sat down to test the attribute out, so I figured this would be the best fit!

// It's still a little boring honestly, but it has like absolutely no niche in Live TF2, either. Spycheck-helper, at most? I decided to make it a bit of a utility for helping scrounge up more metal from metal sources, but that's about itttt.

//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (3:2 New/Old). Adds Kill-Icons]
//
// A new TF2C update calls for a new weapons pack update to match! Truthfully, though, this update sorta came out of nowhere a bit sooner than I expected, so sadly I don't have too much weapons-wise for ya. The ideas I do have are pretty experimental, though!
// But, hey, that's not all, at least! I wanted to take these weapons' authenticity up a level, so what better way than to FINALLY add killicons! Yep, that's right, new icons for everything I've made thus far! It took a bit of doing, but I think I figured out a pretty good way to make 'em in the style of TF2C!
// Paired with these backpack icons I've been doing, and more of my new material and model changes, I hope these push a little closer to being "TF2C quality", silly as my weapons may be! I was already goin' for that, but hopefully it feels even MORE authentic!! Okay, have fun, and kill lots and lots for me~!

// Since very early iterations of my weapon-making attempts, I had a Heavy Chainsaw based on a minigun for a long, long time, but figured it was about time to make it a real, not smoke-and-mirrors weapon! So, now it does. And, with cues from TF2C's new attributes, old ideas, and OF influence, it lives!

// [Update Log: Adds 13 Weapons! (7:6 New/Old)]
//
// I was a little bit unhappy with how relatively small last update was, so to make it up to you, here's a bigger one! It's got new weapons, lots of 'em, and a LOT of QoL fixes! I've been workin' since last update, but I think I'm happy with it in the end!
// This time, I wanted to give most of the folks some interesting - if unconventional - tools. That, and I wanted to chip away more at giving every class at least one non-stock weapon of every type! I think it'd help with making new stuff in the future, for you n' me!

// It came out... alright? Demoman gets more healing from most things, but has an achilles heel in the form of lighting on fire from Pyro (a leftover from that drink-heal phase), so it... maybe works? I think it's inoffensive for now, I might tweak it more!

// All jokes aside, though, as well as conversations about why Civ can't have a conventional gun (TLDR, if he can see enemies to shoot them, they can see him and kill him), I wanted to make an combat-focused weapon in Civilian flavor.
// So, why not have the boost work to that end! Mark a single enemy at a time with Super MfD, and either flee and let your team swarm over the now-vulnerable enemy, or if you're in a pinch, attack 'em yourself!

// Gotta go fast! Go for gold and break the land speed record with the BFB, or die trying! Literally! Although very, very different from its regular TF2 incarnation, I tried to recreate the general niche of the original - run fast, get kills, and DON'T get hit.
// It was difficult finding appropriate analogues for the BFB's properties, but I think speed on kill and MfD works reasonably well enough - the latter being a stand-in for the whole "don't get hit or jump" thing!
// Say, what of the jumping? Well, for now, you can still double jump, I think this iteration of the BFB is already tremendously frontloaded with negative stats, even if the original 2 don't mean much.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.1.5 (Update 5, 5/21/2021)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 19 Weapons! (12:7 New/Old). Adds Response Rules. Adds LoDs globally]
//
// Finally, a new TF2C update appears! And, with it, a new weapons pack update! Lucky you~ As always, though, there's a lotta sleek new toys for y'all to mess around with, and this time, some even come with custom voice responses, just like the regular weapons in TF2C! I was debating for a long time whether or not to edit these, but decided it was worth it for the ~immersion~!
// I also took the time to do a lot - and I mean, a LOT of rebalances for most of the weapons! I'm sure you can tell by now that balance... isn't, exactly one of my strong-suits, but I'm still gonna try, at least. I'm thankful all of you took the time to give me advice about things to change, and want to make the weapons as fun to play with as they are to make!
// I have big, big plans for the next update, and hope to see y'all when TF2C v2.1.0 finally appears! I've had a lot of exciting things I want to show y'all soon, but until then! Well, what are ya waitin' for!? Kick some ass, and shoot some lead!

// Ahh, it's good to see you, old friend. I have history with this particular weapon model all the way back from TF2C B4, so I wanted to do well by it by, finally, adding it back in as a weapon for my new and shiny weapons pack!
// Initially, I was planning several variants, including one that had a hammer-racking animation like a Sniper Rifle, and one built on the PaintballRifle, but I settled simpler was better, and just settled for one using the newly-made and very similar Hunting Revolver!
// From the get-go, it's a much faster, weaker sidegrade of that, but where the Hunting Revolver has a focus on frankly nightmarish stopping power, this offers sheer speed!

//
// For those times an enemy is (annoyingly) hovering just outside of your range and you really need some way to get them to approach or flee... up the ante a little, with a shotgun that has less spread! This is a simple, but effective, little tool for your arsenel.
// Initially, this began as a Heavy shotgun, and I was flirting with the idea of just having it unconditionally do more damage, but that's... not terribly interesting. So, how about giving it more bullets and making those somewhat more accurate! I suppose Pyro can have it, too, they've been a good [censored]~

// [Overview: Sniper - A Kukri that does massive bonus damage against vulnerable foes!]
//
// Whack, thwack, smack! Cut loose and cut, hack, and slash your foes to pieces with the beloved kukri, the Bushwacka! This was a relatively early concept, but even when it started working, there was the problem of... figuring out how to balance it around NOWP's Sniper.
// See, he plays the same, but he has a LOT more tools at his disposal that apply MfD - and thus make this thing do full crits! It's a bit scary, and for the time being all I have (in addition to the old downsides) is a slower swing speed.
// It's... something? It's still scary, to be sure, but the swing speed is slow enough to put you in some danger using this. Cut your foes down, but be wary of them doing the exact same to you.

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Basil PFP / OCsonic, azzy (Thermal Thruster)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 32 Weapons! (14:18 New/Old). Adds texture mipmaps globally. Updates Kill-Icons to use hooks]
//
// Well, this has been a long time coming, but after so, so long, the Big Update is here! For NOWP, that is. While TF2C v2.1.0 takes its sweet time to appear, I think it really is due time I show y'all what I've been working on for this long...!!
// This is, by far, the biggest update I've ever made for any of my mods, by a LONG shot! Dozens of new weapons, too many balance changes, new responses, cleanup and polish all-around, and even more, all with the goal of making New-Old Weapons Pack the best it can possibly be! So, I really, really do hope that reflects in this update of a lifetime!
// That said... this update cycle sure has been something. Having worked on this for the better part of the year, I think this should be a good spot to leave the mod in for a bit. I hope you all enjoy, and blast eachother to smithereens! Just like I (and K.R. Fawkes) would have intended. Ehehe...

// A weapon from TF2C's early-mid development returns, it's the Makeshift Mutilator, a chemical-flamethrower! Initially, this was essentially just lifted out of that version, but I wanted to do a different spin on it since a flamethrower that... just, does more damage, is a bit dull.
// Over time, I settled on trying to make it a flamethrower that does more damage, but only situationally. As it is currently, it has a single-target focus and excels at building-busting and VIP-hunting, but suffers when it comes to really causing groups to panic. Or, I hope so.
// Sigh... there's a lot more to do here, but it is what it is! I was briefly spitballing an acid-ball flamethrower... which honestly might be good enough to make its own weapon... hmm~

// THAT'S RIGHT - RED ALERT!! MEDIC HAS A SHOTGUN! But, don't panic, this version is the closest I could do to get it working in a half-believable way for Medic... it STILL fires syringes! This sounds like a minor detail, but it's very important it stays.
// If allowed to be hitscan, well someone would just use that over a projectile weapon, any projectile weapon, if they have the choice, since you do damage instantly as soon as you press the button. So, having projectiles still allows this to... sorta... fit Medic's existing playstyle!
// Well, does it fit well? Probably not! But, I wanted to try, and I'm reasonably happy with the result. All said, though, it's a lot weaker than a regular Shotgun even so, so keep those Syringe Guns handy!

// That's not all it has going for it, though - nails, as a base property of theirs, have quite good damage even at mid-range, so this means that this minigun is unusually good at a slightly further out range than Heavy's usual fare!

// The Caber... kinda, returns! This weapon has had a really messy development - initially, it was a weird hybrid weapon that did minicrits against "aiming" players (aka Snipers), hearkening back to those clips of Demomen obliterating Snipers across the battlements.
// Later on, it got more prototypes to actually make it... yknow, explode. On hit. No such luck, sadly, but I got it to explode!! Don't look behind the curtain, it's kinda a mess, haa... But, all said, this (newer) iteration has promise!
// Honestly, Caber has a half-decent chance of one day actually having its mechanics added, but for now, this gimmicky facsimile will have to suffice...

// [Overview: Engineer - A PDA that makes Dispensers and Teleporters build and act VERY fast, but with dramatically low defenses.]
//
// Hoo, this is a doozy. This PDA is, in short, a supercharged Gunslinger, or maybe a Mini-Buildings PDA as a whole. Just like how the Gunslinger deploys faster, weaker sentries, this is intended to deploy faster, weaker buildings in general.
// As one could guess due to this being, well, all of them at once, it effectively has three entire weapons' worth of internals to wrangle with!! As a result, though, it makes a hyper-offense focused Engineer toolkit. Build fast, think fast, move fast.
// This item... I'll be honest is likely to get instantly obliterated into like 2-3 sub-weapons come the removal of custom PDAs, which I'm not looking forward to, but is a reality that's getting closer!! Hoo boy!
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Dispensers and Teleporters build fast.
// Buildings have 127 HP (from 150). Buildings can't be upgraded. Dispenser + Teleporter cost 30% less metal to build (130 70 35)
// Dispenser generates surplus metal and do more healing. Teleporter builds as fast as a Jump Pad
// When combined with the split variant, Buildings have 82 HP (from 150), Build Cost is reduced, etc

// [Overview: Engineer - A SBL that shoots a Dispenser landmine, to defend a single area at a time. See: Mine Layer, Explosive Dispenser]
//
// One day, I was hazily taking a shower at like 2 AM, and suddenly, the words "The Dispenserizer" appeared in my head. Rapt by this, I knew immediately I had to fully realize that this even entailed. A manic night ensued, but sure enough, at the end... was the Dispenserizer.
// That aside, I had been toying previously with the idea of area landmines that acted more as deterrents or detection tools. So, in a strange twist of fate, this became a realization of that concept! A diet mine-layer for Engineer, essentially.
// Engi can deter people off of any one flank of his choice, or at least know people are coming! Powerful as it is, it replaces his Shotgun (now, anyway), and doesn't do a horrible amount of damage, so you'd still strictly be better using a Shotgun for direct combat! I hope, anyway.

// Honestly? I think I'm finally onto something, here. Surprisingly simple for the base idea, this is a semi fast-firing mid-range weapon with projectiles abound. You use it like a Sniper Rifle. And the Huntsman. And the Hunting Revolver. And maybe more! Whoa! -blows up self with my mind-

//
// The soothing sound of extreme violins... now in TF2C! The second attempt at trying to make another supportive weapon off-class, I wanted to try bringing the Amputator back with the limited tools available!
// As it is right now, the only real healing-related condition is... defense boost. So, I bit the bullet, and gave it a try! It's... alright! Maybe? The rest of the properties are the same, beside some tests I did for nerfing boost-weapons.
// Of course, if they ever add a taunt-heal, and especially if they add radius modifiers to it, I'd love to tackle this in its true form! But, for now, this is the best I can do... ideas-willing.

// [Overview: Sniper - A Kukri that causes long-lasting bleed! Also swings faster... See: Fishwhacker]
//
// Certainly not the most terribly-exciting weapon to see, but it has sentimental value to me, dammit! Your favorite (or least favorite) wooden blade returns, and it acts just about how you'd expect it to; it causes bleed and does less damage, simple as.
// I figured it'd be a fun fold to also make it swing faster since it has almost nothing else going for it (crit vs. bleeding is already taken by Fishwhacker, so no-go), and it... works! All said, I think it feels like a servicable, if simple little weapon.
// I really just have strangely fond memories of this as, of course, one of the first Sniper weapons I'd ever gotten, if not one of the first in general. It may be a dinky little wooden knife, but it's memorable to me!! A hand-me-down from a time long passed... -sniffles-

// [Update Log: Adds 14 Weapons! (8:6 New/Old)]
//
// Hey! I... wasn't expecting to be back so soon, but no rest for the wicked, I guess! In any case, I've already prepped a bunch of new weapons and a LOT, I mean a LOT of balance changes for y'all! Hopefully this... works?
// ...If I might be blunt, I think the fatigue is starting to set in, I hadn't really even gotten any real rest from last update before I needed to hurry back and push this update to fix the balancing. Which, might I remind you, I'm not stellar at!
// Well, I think THIS time, I've earned a solid break. Thus far I've made 7 entire updates for TF2C v2.0.0 and its patches... and I just want to take a breather for a while, until next update actually decides to release! Think of it as an extended summer vacation! Take a load off and spill some blood, hopefully I'll see y'all soon...!

//
// The Third Degree - hey, waitwait! Don't go!! It ISN'T a direct upgrade this time...! Phew, okay, sorry, I got worried there for a sec, but yeah, not a direct upgrade this time!
// This was mostly spurred about as I realized, the crit-vs-cond attribute DOES happen to, mysteriously, have a bitflag for a few odd healing ones... including one for actively being healed right now! That got me thinking, and I eventually decided to try my hand at this!
// All said, though, it does have ONE downside, but it's a notable one; you do half as much damage. Simple upside, simple downside, but it means your average axe swings deal a measly 33 DMG, and 99 against a heal-target! So, make it count, and catch them off guard before they realize what's happening...

//
// Since having seen and played Yakibomb's Renaissance Revival weapons pack, I immediately loved the comedy value of their own guitar that became the namesake for this, the Bonkulele (1)! In that mod, it always crits on the first hit and does normal damage after.
// To be honest, I sorta started there, and worked backwards. As it is right now, it's a simple healstick - you get health back while it's held out, but you're at risk from enemy attack while doing so! Can imagine you'd be sitting down, relaxing, strumming a tune...
// ...before, of course, bashing someone's head clean in with it. Hey, something special happens if you hit someone that's airborne with this! That'll teach 'em.

// A peculiar weapon, the Liberty Launcher makes its appearance! It's quite an odd weapon at first blush, since none of the stats particularly jump out at you... or even seem to work together at all.

// Maybe this should have jumped out at me sooner, ha, considering it's a companion piece to the MG! And it has 5 rockets. And a higher proj. speed. For some reason? For liberty.

//
// A new challenger arrives on the Pyro Projectile-Launcher scene... it's the (former) Molotov Launcher! This weapon has had a... messy... history, but I think I'm finally happy with where it is currently, so we'll see if that stays.
// My initial ideas were to have it shoot Molotovs that provide a lingering AoE effect, but that... didn't really pan out. I don't think any of us really liked the 4-shot explosive molotovs, either, and it was just so bulky and... y'know what? Back to the drawing board!
// I figured for a rework of this, I wanted to focus more on it being a more general-purpose, faster, easier to use slant on the DF! Fast, low damage, decent splash, and otherwise no special effects. Simple, but feels and looks a lot better than before. We'll see if it needs more spice, soon...!

// The Zatoichi is Backoichi! Okay, that sounded better in my head, teehee. In either case, implementing the weapon was... simpler... than I expected. Huh.
// The whole "honorbound" system doesn't really work, so I made a facsimile by having it deduct health upfront and always switch pretty slowly off. Beside, the weapon is already fairly strong as-is - it heals HALF of your max HP even in Live!!
// I might work on this more, but it's highly unlikely that they'll add any of the specific mechanics for this... on the bright side, the 1hko mechanic works! YOU'RE the only one that deserves a katana around here, after all! Not those other SCHMUCKS.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.5.0 (Update 8, 4/29/2022)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 29 Weapons! (14:16 New/Old). Adds Secret Weapons. Updates items_game to use hooks]
//
// IT'S FINALLY HERE! To match with the monumental occassion of a NEW MAJOR UPDATE, I've assembled one of the biggest updates New-Old Weapons Pack has yet seen, with dozens of new weapons, restored function for old weapons, and so. So much polish. To make this maybe the single best version of NOWP yet!!
// I really can't understate how much of everything changed, everything I could think of to fix, simplify, and overhaul - I did so. I've been planning this update out from as soon as early 2021, even working concurrently with my earlier updates, and always having planned this to be a simple patch to add some goodies for TF2C v2.1.0!
// Well, evidently, things took a little longer than intended, and I had to roll some stuff back into NOWP v2.2.5. But, I think, this is it. The update, as I always meant it to be, is FINALLY OUT!! Paint the badlands red today, boys, you've earned it. Make us proud.

// Demoman finally gets a shield! This, initially, was intended to be the Chargin' Targe, but given how TF2C's shields work with their complete turn freedom, I didn't feel it was right to implement it as-is. So, instead of that, I added this!
// This shield existing should be a familiar baseline, although not identical to Live. It doesn't strictly have 'downsides', per-se, but here it acts somewhat as the "default" shield, in a similar role the C. Targe held originally. So, not much special going on.
// Since the charge turning is a property of ALL shields, as of writing, this has a faster recharge time to act as a more readily available mobility option that recharges somewhat fast!
//
// Other Notes:
// Stock Weapon for the purposes of other weapons. Not actually a stock weapon.

// Getcha gaming gear on like it's 1999, because the Incendiary Cannon claws its way out of the past and into the far-flung future of 1960's midwestern America! Ever since learning of the general concept of it,
// being the TF2 Flamethrower's descendant, I wanted to try my hand at seeing how it'd work with the more updated gameplay of TF2. Instead of flames, it shoots incendiary rockets VERY quickly, and otherwise shares a lot with the modern flamer!
// I wanted to (re-)design it as a sort of in-between for the Flamethrower and the DF... fast, consistent damage with projectiles albeit less capable of sheer crowd control.

//
// Other Notes:
// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a fairly long time and was ALMOST confident in releasing, the Helicopter Gun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it applied very weak pushback force onto Heavy to allow him to hover in the air if he shoots directly downward. Offset by extremely low ammo, low dps, and extra fall damage (don't sleep on this it HURTS)
// However, despite my best efforts, there was too much weirdness with all sorts of things like explosives, Jump Pads, and even -water- making Heavy skyrocket into the Skybox. This wasn't something I think people would stomach dealing with...

// [Overview: Spy - A Sapper that does more damage faster, but on a strict timer! See: RTR]
//
// Making a Sapper unlock is tricky business; a lot of the properties of what makes a Sapper, "a Sapper", weren't at all controlled by items_game.txt or even the weapon script... it's mostly controlled by objects.txt, the file for buildings!
// That was, up until recently, but even so the only thing that changed was the ability to set a custom view and world model, as well as SOME stats. Still, I felt this was enough to make a simple new Sapper, failing my ideas for a RTR port.
// In principle, though, this DOES replicate part of it still: It drains health INCREDIBLY fast relative to the stock Sapper! Unlike the RTR, though, it's less sturdy, not more. And it even removes itself quickly. Use this to get an Engineer to panic and try to force an opening for attack!

// A perfect use for all of your über-filled needles and syringes, the Overdose returns, this time with a slightly different slant on an übercharge-centric syringegun! It centers on an odd stat that buffs your charge build rate. 
// Since the speed-with-total-charge stat doesn't exist, this one temporarily and incrementally boosts your übercharge rate by a small amount on every hit, up to some total, for 6s! To suit this, it keeps the damage penalty and gets slower firing, too...
// It's interesting, if perhaps a bit strong in its utility. If I'm able, I'd love to return the original Overdose, and then split this into a new syringe gun~ Until then, this is just -drumrolls- a prototype...!!

// [Overview: A Pistol that does INCREDIBLE damage at close range, but has horrific accuracy and ammo problems. See: Twin-Barrel, Panic Attack]

// An odd little weapon, a slant on the new Twin-Barrel on a class (or classes, rather) that don't even have it! From the get-go, this is a riskier but rewarding alternative to both a Shotgun and Pistol.
// It does tremendous damage... if things work out right. It can't hit the broad side of a barn, and has almost no ammo, but it can almost wipe out somebody's health if used essentially point-blank! Also usable in Medieval. Hehe.

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (8:3 New/Old). Adds custom particles]
//
// It's the moment you've all been waiting for... for both TF2C, and NOWP! It was a long wait, but hopefully worth it - I started work on this update (and even the previous one, NOWP v2.6.5!) with anticipation for TF2C v2.1.2's features, and it's finally here!
// To start, I wanted to try making a lot of new, inventive weapons, this time - weapons I don't usually make variants for! On top of that, I wanted to really push QoL to the next level in a way I haven't done in some time. How? Well, new particles for EVERYTHING, new supplemental mods like dropped mags and shells, and more fixes than I can count!!
// It's been a while, but I really am happy with how this update turned out, despite everything. My goal has always been to make these silly things with a level of quality on-par with Eminoma / TF2C Team's own efforts for TF2C, and I think I'm just about there... finally... But, enough about me. Stop gawkin', and start killin'!

// I actually noticed some interesting feedback from the previous version of the Quick-Fix, and its shorter übers, so I took cues from that as well as the Vaccinator to make a high turn-around medigun! Get über faster, but the duration itself is only enough for a few quick, decisive fights.
// Paired with the slightly lower performance for actually healing teammates, and you'll have reasons to use this as much as you have reasons to use other Mediguns for the situation! I hope, anyway. No science is done without the potential of making mistakes~

// Alongside the new weapons are even more QoL changes, like bloodied weapons on crit-kills, and FINALLY fixing that stupid Medigun beam bug after months of work (no thanks to a certain server), so hopefully NOWP will finally be... okay, hhh, look, I need to level with you for a moment.
// I'm so, so tired. It's thankless work, and having to play fix-up because somebody else can't be bothered to properly maintain their own work has been getting increasingly frustrating to me.

// Since a few convenient things worked out, like the stat for it working, the time of year being right, and me being upset at how AWFUL it looks in Live TF2, I decided I wanted to try my hand at bringing back the infamous Candy Cane, but with more than 5 minutes of work put in!
// The visuals have been tidied up, and importantly, the stats are back too, and even with a new twist! I felt the original candy cane was a bit boring, so I added a small overhealing-mechanic to it.

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (9:2 New/Old)]
//
// Welcome back! I missed y'all, and this time I have the biggest update in, shoot, a while! All this time off meant I had a lot of time to reflect, but also a lot of time to put polish and effort into making these again! Not that I wasn't before, but I think you can tell the last few were a little bit rushed, haa...
// This time, everybody gets a new toy or gadget to play with, the QoL is as high as it's ever been, and the balancing! Well, I still suck at balancing, but I've made an effort to rebalance almost everything slightly! This update, for the first time in a long time, has a little bit of everything!
// I'm happy with it, I really am. But, I've gotten to thinking about the longevity of New-Old Weapons Pack, and I don't want it to grow forever like certain other projects. So, I think it's time I think about closure, soon...! But, not quite yet. So, while you still have little ol' me here, maim some people and make me happy!

// It does more damage with mini-crit boosts! But, there's a catch. While I can't also make Scout vulnerable during that same time period... yet, he'll take more damage from any crit, which includes the minicrits he'll take from melees!

// Toasters? Who needs 'em! Become the talk of the town - or at least your local public sewers - with this electrifying new not-flaregun! It's about time I made a new one, so I wanted to try making things interesting.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v3.2.1 (Update 13, 1/24/2025)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (5:0 New/Old)]
//
// Do you hear those ominous bells tolling? Eh, probably nothing to worry about -- look, it's another update! The second to last! I was debating whether or not to just put everything into my last-last update, later this year, but decided I wanted to accompany a TF2C major update, just one more time. Once more, for the road, a minor update!
// Another patch, another set of new toys for ya. Admittedly, I was hoping to make more for this middle-update, but I just need more time and content for the remainder of my ideas! But, you'll see the last of my big ideas, with any luck, soon enough. Hang in there, we're almost done...! Until then, I'll knuckle down for y'all, and get a-crackin' for a last update y'all deserve and can be happy with!
// And, until then, I'll... think about what I want to do after. Even now, I don't want to entirely give up, but I'm determined next time will be the last major update with y'all. Maybe, just maybe, I'll release smaller patches onto it. Small surprises to accompany my completed masterwork... ehe... one can dream. But, otherwise... ciao, for now. 'Till we meet again... friends. See you soon.

// Well, well, weld, if it isn't an old-fashioned welder (or blowtorch!) This idea's been everpresent for some time, whether very early in TF2's development or with community ideas, but I wanted to see how I could get such a strange concept to work - so I got crackin'!
// Generally speaking, most people either make it a secondary pistol-replacement that uses metal as ammo to heal buildings, which I both can't do and dislike, or they just have it be a regular melee like any other Wrench, but it ignites now! But, I'd seen very few recreations really tackle how something like this'd work.
// Eventually, I settled for this strange variant - a very fast, rapidly firing melee that continually heals buildings. Great for healing off small increments, like from chip damage or ammo drain, but baaaad at dealing with burst from Engi's normal foes. For now, it works, but we'll have to see how it turns out! Strap on your Hotrods, boys, we've got a heap of weldin' to do!

// It was a bit awkward figuring out a niche, at first - initially, I wanted to make it quite similar to Gravity Gun-punted harpoons in HL2, but did discover inadvertantly that piercing projectiles otherwise fills a niche Sniper doesn't have a clean option for; multi-target!
// However, a big catch takes a long time to reel in. Most of the weapon's actions - firing, charging, and even the harpoon itself are quite slow, so quickscopes aren't too great. Instead, why not set up shop, wait a while down a narrow sightline or for clusters of enemies, and charge all the way for a clean, clean catch? Ahh, they'll be fresh shrimp on the barbie.

//
// Who said giant, bone-piercing arrows can't be medicinal!? Prove your allies wrong and your enemies right, with the grand return of the classic medicinal crossbow! "Now with actual healing!"
// For quite a long time, this just focused on damage. Re-creating the basic functions of the Crossbow is easy enough, I've even done it 3 times to date. The tricker part is the details, like the inverted rampup, which also returns.
// And finally, the healing is back! But, toned down significantly... I don't want this to completely outshine any other Syringe Gun AGAIN, so it only ever heals up to 45 HP. A great asset, but hopefully think about the others...!

// Initially drafted by Kris, this weapon went through quite many iterations, before I settled on something that, surprisingly, worked! In its current iteration, this takes some scrapped TF2C concepts and turns it into a single weapon!
// The "combo" mechanic was, admittedly, a huge pain to figure out, but I remain startled at how well it works! I still have work to do on this thing yet - especially if they add either of the two scrapped concept weapons it's based on, finally, but for now, this should do!

//
// This weapon, truly, was and is a monster of moving parts. I'm still thoroughly astounded Colrot did as much of this basework as they did - this is a miracle of engineering! Functions aside, though, it's just the LC!
// The Loose Cannon itself is such a peculiar weapon, but the basic workings of it survive into TF2C with this - time your grenades well and use it to combo off of itself for a big, big blast! Complete with the thunk noise!
// It DOES have some mechanical differences, most notably being unable to reload, but given how nightmarish the scripting for this weapon is, I think we can live with that for now...

// A watch form of the Big Earner, or a "I gotta gtfo now" watch. First weapon I made for this pack, such humble beginnings it was..
// This weapon has evolved a lot, it began as an idea for a Kunai watch, where your cloak meter was replaced with a health storage bar, that would be built up from murdering, and you would press M2 to give yourself some hp/overheal... until I realized that this wouldn't be possible. Not even the health on kill stat applying to ever weapon. So, back to the drawing board!
// Kiri kinda made the design of this for me. A really short, but extreme speed boost watch. Get hit while cloaked or uncloak early? Too bad, it's all gone! It doesn't recharge on it's own, so you need to kill people or pickup ammo boxes to refill it.

// [Overview: Engineer - An arm augmentation that increases mobility by flinging yourself forward when you punch, and minicrits with successive hits. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is *a* Gunslinger! Instead of just buffing your health and providing a mini combat sentry, it instead buffs your health, provides extra mobility, and more damage with multiple hits in a row, at the cost of weaker and level limited buildings. This'll let you get a sentry up in a spot you wouldn't normally be able to, 
// but don't expect to be able to maintain it against direct fire! Could also be useful for retreating, or being a real gun slinger and being right up in the fray!
// The Sentry does less damage, but not as less as the PDQ or Gunslinger.
//
// Other Notes:
// Punching people sets them on fire for a second, the afterburn doesn't deal any damage. Hitting burning targets does minicrit damage. This was done to somewhat replicate Live TF2's Gunslinger's niche but unique 3-hit combo mechanic.
// Upgrading is slowed down by a bit. You only get to spend 20 metal instead of 25, meaning you have to hit a building 10 times to upgrade it, down from the 8 times wit the Stock Wrench.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50). It doesn't give you a mini-sentry tho.
// When combined with the jump pad, you get to absolutely FLY across maps!
// You'll take minicrits from projectiles while in the air, so watch out for that!

// [Overview: Pyro - An SMG that does minicrits on burning targets!]
//
// A new SMG, but for the Pyro! Admittedly, this weapon came somewhat from a spot of self-indulgence, and probably isn't really damage centered, but it makes me happy, dangit!
// It's a basic SMG, not too much to it, all aside. Higher clip, lower reserve, minicrits against burning targets, and more damage overall! The main downside, which isn't listed, is that it's not a shotgun or a flaregun.

// Other Notes:
// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a long while and was nearly confident in releasing, A bolt launcher + nailgun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it would shoot fast moving, large hitbox, high damage bolts. Offset by extremely low ammo, low fire rate, and extra low clip size.
// However, despite my best efforts, this thing has become an exercise in "I can't understand what stats I need to use to make this feel right and not become useless."

// Whoa, what's that? A new training weapon!? Don't mind if I do! Straight from the vaults of the K.R. Fawkes Arms Dealership itself, it's the Ultimate Jumper! The last "Jumper" you'll ever need, it's powered by the most powerful explosives known to man... concrete bricks. You'll be the master of the lost art of Brick Jumping in no time!
// What's that, you want to hear about it's combat abilities? Sorry, I don't have anything to say, it's easily the weakest TF2C weapon there is. Just, absolutely pitiful. Don't even try using it against enemies, what ever will they think of you!? If not for the Brick Jumping, who would EVER want to use a weapon like this!?
// It's just so, so pitifully weak, so weak that Mr. Fawkes himself sealed it away inside 23 separate vaults, all booby-trapped with metric tons of high explosives. Please, just stop thinking of it as a weapon. It's just a training tool, and we promise that it won't eviscerate everybody in front of you - including yourself! H-hey, wait, where are you going!? Sir? Madame!? That'll be $1.49!!

// Ahh, the Skullbuster. This weapon and I go quite a ways back to before I even knew how to mod. It was one of the first mods I'd used as a kid, and I ended up making a revamped version of it... because SOME people on the workshop though it'd be cool to make a new version and NOT release it! Thanks, TF2 Workshoppers.
// That aside, I thought it would be cute - if a bit dumb looking - to have this finally make it into the Weapons Pack after all these years. I think it deserves the spot, although I'm starting to regret it since he won't shut up. Do you still have the shovel I gave you?

// Much like the Golden Wrench, this arose out of a childlike whimsy of just wanting to finally be able to use a GMG in-game... and now you can, too! It even comes with pure gold-plated mags AND a metallic twinge with every shot!
// Well? Not much else to say here, mate. Get a-fraggin' like it's 2009 all over again! Put on Propane Nightmares for good measure, you've earned it.

// Well, you're in luck! A mixup at the Bonesaw Factory and the Syringe Factory created a somehow-familiar looking weapon... a fearsome looking saw with a blade and syringe to match, we'll call it... "The Übersaw". And it could be yours, for a low, low payment of $4.99!
// (Okay, for a serious summary - I just like the old Übersaw, and wanted to have it back. It has the old stats, if you want those! But, it makes little difference, an übersaw's an überspritze's an über-weapon! Saw through their bones like it's 2008!)

//
// When TF2C team pushed TF2C's first official release, Death & Taxes, it also included were a few very, very interesting remnants of scrapped content and weapons. The AA Gun was one of them... and I've attempted to re-create it! With some creative liberties, of course~
// Originally, it was some sort of "Minigun" with a much more limited clipsize that shot explosives of... some, kind. Heavy can also blast jump with it by default! So, that's cool! I decided to fold all of these into my new iteration of it, so hopefully it's fun to mess with!
// To my surprise... they decided to finally, actually re-visit the AAGun idea, and officially released it the next update! So, not wanting to totally remove this, I gave this an honorary Vintage quality, and reworked it to be a might faster-firing variant! Complete with blast jump... it's important to the LORE.

// If this ends up being dumb, whatever. it's a seperate experimental weapon for a reason :P -Clock's assistant

// I saw it while consuming seriamon's delicous slop and figured it would be an interesting potential rework to the Le Chevalier.

				// The base is some kind of gun. Change fire rate, ammo, ect. to act like a knife. No reloads, no spread, same fire rate. Knives hit instantly so that's not a concern.
				// The bullet fired needs to have no tracer and emulate melee combat as closely as possible.
				// to emulate melee range:
				// default bullet range is 4096 hU'S, default melee range is 48 with an extra 18 from the bounding box (66 hU's total) sourced from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb8XfWyUOcg
				// to change bullet range to melee, use 0.01611328125 projectile range. (multiply after for any range bonuses, present here)
				// unfortunately, bullets hit player body hitboxes instead of bounding boxes. This is necessary for headshots, so this will just be listed as "Melee hits are extremely precise" as a downside.

// It's no secret that this kind of weapon is really underwhelming, KOCW had this kind of weapon, and only ever saw use when engineer stacking after they introduced an engineer cap there, 
// and it kind of sucked at actually keeping a nest up. Which of course, made it get complained about enough to get nerfed into the ground. This is KOCW we're talking about here. (Eternal skill issue)
// Albiet, maybe it's more useful in VIP mode, but I highly doubt that. Plus, ultimately, it just makes an already overly passive class even more passive.
// So, I thought, what if I let this have some kind of buff? Well, traditional buffs are a bit out of the question, due to how weird that'd be to implement.
// But, I thought that this getting a version of engie's ether spell could be a really good way to make this a lot better and more practical.
// There's no other civ weapons that can give ammo after all. That's  an interesting thing for him to be able to do, and leans into the concept at play here.

// New-Old Weapons Pack! Custom Stats / Attributes
//-----
// [Overview: A set of new stats / attributes, mostly to add custom stat-text but also to fix or tweak some stuff! Everything here's already included in some way in default TF2C!]
//
// At long last, with NOWP v2.5.0, this mod now uses custom attributes!! For the most part, it's mostly used for new text-display, but occasionally also for stat functions! Thanks to azzy, of course, for letting attributes accept plaintext descriptions~!
// Really, as mentioned, I mostly just make use of these to change stat text - be that making new text not present in tf2c_english.txt, or simplifying wording to not be so ridiculously wordy, or even just changing colors around. It's simple work, and NOWP hardly -needs- it per-se, but it helps make it all feel just that bit more official. Really.
// If you're modding New-Old Weapons Pack, or using one of its weapons, it'd probably be best if you copy any relevant attributes from here to your project. The game might fuss, piss itself, cry, and / or die (probably in that order) otherwise, if you don't.
