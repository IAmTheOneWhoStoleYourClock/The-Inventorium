//
// Welcome to the end of the world and my mind!
// In all seriousness, though, this is going to get messy.
// In order for your silly little client to understand what's going on, all of these need to be in one file. (I think)
// To enable these for private use, just take these files from your downloads folder and put them in your custom folder (i think) you'll need to put it in a new folder for the game to not explode though.
// If you want a "pure" download, download it from github here: 
// If you're here to see how your favourite weapon operates under the hood, buckle up cause you're in for a ride.
// If you're one of the developers that made these packs, double check you're strapped in cause it's going to likely be even worse for you to see how i've butchered your babies. (I jest. Mostly.)
// These packs are up to date as of 31/03/2025, with the exception of ReValve, because I already implented most of the updates changes anyways.
// If you are a weapon maker or modeler featured in this pack and would like to have your models/weapons removed, contact me on discord (@clockstealer) or make an issue on the github page.
// Also, apologies for the poor grammar in advance. -Clock

//-------------------------------------------------------------------// For some sense of convenience, I'll try to keep my weapons up in the 3300-4500 ID range. Higher than that, I won't touch - feel free to use those for your own stuff!
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// FUNCTIONALLY though, I should only need like, 3300-4000. 8+ Updates later, and I've only barely scratched up to using maybe 300 total. Still, from now on, I'll do my best to keep in this range. You have my word.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// I'm unsure how other Weapons Packs want to handle it, but having all of our stuff cordoned off into copy-and-pasteable chunks might help quite a bit!
//-- NEW-OLD WEAPONS PACK ITEMS AREA (3300 - 4500)-------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Also, if you're wondering why such a specific number; TF2C v2.0.0 Release had its unlockable items all the way up at about the 3000 range. I figured I'd start mine at 3300 to be safe.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That's enough for the 10 classes to get 10 official weapons in EVERY weapon slot, including PDAs! Needless to say, that's far more than even Live TF2 ever had (not counting reskins).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Granted, later they reverted to having the new items be in the low 32-50's range, so that left a huge amount of space in-between. I'm not moving my weapons closer, so if you want anything that shows up BEFORE my stuff - try there!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v1.0.0 (Update 1, 7/30/2020)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Yakibomb (Crusader's Crossbow)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 40 Weapons! (13:27 New/Old)]
//
// And so, my humble weapons mod turns a new leaf and begins a new stage on its journey! Old friends and subscribers of mine might remember a time a decade ago when I was making all sorts of strange weapons for TF2C's v2.0.0 B4! It was fun then, and my hope is that it'll be fun now!
// In this first update, you'll find many returning items, both from my old projects as well as from regular TF2, and even TF2C's scrapped ideas, but I've made sure to include plenty of brand new toys to play with, too!
// Hopefully, your backpack doesn't feel so bare anymore, haha! I only plan to add more, as I get the ideas, so keep an eye out! And, hopefully, you'll have fun using this all these new weapons to maim eachother with! Have fun!

// [Overview: A Stock Reskin with HL1 flair! Unremarkable as a starting weapon goes.]
//
// In a way, beside literally being the first weapon here, the Crowbar might well be one of my first custom weapons... ever. Its story goes all the way back to the infancy of TF2C, back when the game was little more than 2007 TF2 with a Nailgun.
// I had found an SFM Crowbar in Meet the Medic's files, and wanted to make that a weapon, so I did! I kept pushing for it to be an all-class weapon like in TFC on FP Forums, but kept getting rebuffed. However, it eventually made it onto Mercenary!!
// ...who was later taken away by Class Protective Services. Whee. But, long story short, that meant I was free to just, add it back in, as a REAL all-class item, when the time came to finally make my own bundle of stuff!
//
// Other Notes:
// Since this is the very first weapon, I'll go into detail what tends to go into ANY given custom weapon!
// If you're curious about it, take a gander, otherwise feel free to skim onto the other things further down! Have fun~
// Things marked with [!] are important to have in some form no matter what, so pay extra attention to those!
//--------------------------------------------------
		"3300" 																					// [Item ID] 			[!] A unique number ID for this specific weapon! Every wpn (& variants) can only use one ID number each, so make sure you don't re-use any numbers! Most of my stuff hangs out in the 3300's and above.
		{
			"name"						"TF_WEAPON_CROWBAR"										// [Internal Name] 		- A name for some backend stuff! Set this to anything, or leave it out entirely if you like. Rarely has any effect, but sometimes gets used by Response Rules, if you mess with those.
			"prefab"					"weapon_bat"											// [Prefab] 			- A Prefab is a set of basic, predefined info - like what base weapon it is, or what classes use it - if you're making a variant of an existing weapon. Use these to save time - or set info manually if you wish! This mod has no custom prefabs, so look for examples in regular items_game.txt!
			"item_class"				"tf_weapon_bat"											// [Item Class] 		[!] What item_class is this using as a base, for basic weapon functions! Most base weapons in TF2 have useful properties, so experiment. For many of these keyvalues, these are already defined in a prefab, if using one.
			"item_slot"					"melee"													// [Item Slot]			[!] What loadout slot is this equipped in? Probably a good idea to set this, if the prefab doesn't! Note, somewhat weird behavior can result if you try to put an item in a different slot than it usually is, I won't cover that here!
			"anim_slot"					"melee"													// [Anim. Set]			- What animation set does it use in-game? This isn't needed most of the time, but can be helpful for unique weapons that use different animations (like a Secondary using Primary animations)
			"show_in_armory"			"1"														// [Show in Loadout] 	[!] VERY important for any weapon! Essentially, does it show up in your Loadout to select? This should always be enabled on any weapon you ever make!!

			"image_inventory_size_w"	"128"													// [BP Image Size]		[!] These are only useful if you AREN'T using a prefab, this just tells TF2 how wide and tall a BP image is! It freaks out if no info's defined, fun.
			"image_inventory_size_h"	"82"

			"propername"				"0"														// [Is a Proper-Name?]	- If enabled, adds the prefix "The " (or localized variant) to an item's name! As a quick rule, say "a Crowbar" or "the Crowbar" aloud; if it seems like there's multiple in any base and the name is just what it is, leave this disabled. If it seems singular, custom-made, or like its name is a "Product Name", then enable this!
			"item_name_color"			"204 204 250 255"										// [Name Color]			- A custom color for the item's name! You can use it as a stand-in for unique item rarities, if you like. The format is RGBA, and the last number is always 255 unless you're weird!
			"item_name"					"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Name]			[!] The display name of the item! This accepts plaintext, but #TF_Localization is nice if present! You can put fake-prefix words at the start of a name to stand-in for modifiers like new rarities, or stuff like killstreak or strange indicators!
			"item_type_name"			"#TF_Weapon_Crowbar"									// [Item Type]			- What kind of generic object is this? Be concise! Use terms like "Rifle" or "Fire Extinguisher", and only add extra descriptive adjectives if it's absolutely nessecary!
			"item_description"			"
Good for bashing a chucklehead's skull in."														// [Description] 		[!] A description box! Explain extra weapon functions, include short quotes, or just leave helpful info! Use TF2C's descriptions as a style-guide - you can mimic quotes by doing 'this' or “this”, and you can include linebreaks by making a new line in your text editor! You can see some examples below.
			"item_logname"				"crowbar"												// [Console Log Name]	- What it's called when referred to in Dev. Console's killfeed. This doesn't really do much, but it's good practice to have this be the same as the actual kill-icon name.
			"item_iconname"				"crowbar"												// [Kill-Icon]			[!] A kill-icon sprite to use, from mod_textures.txt! Adding new kill-icons is a long process, so you can leave this out, and it'll use the default kill-icon for the type of weapon you're using anyway!
			"image_inventory"			"backpack/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar"					// [Backpack Icon]		[!] A Backpack icon, used for your Loadout! Important note; TF2C automatically adds "_large.vmt" to the filename and tries loading that, so ".../w_crowbar" actually looks for ".../w_crowbar_large.vmt"! Keep this in mind...
			"model_world"				"models/weapons/w_models/w_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [World Model]		[!] A weapon's w_model - used for holding the weapon on your playermodel. You can often use Live TF2 c_models as w_models, but TF2C adds many new features, so be mindful!!
			"model_player"				"models/weapons/v_models/v_crowbar_scout.mdl"			// [C / View Model]		[!] A weapon's v_model, or c_model! TF2C viewmodels are a weapon model and viewmodel anims on the same model, and that's it. Class arms are attached on afterward, so decompile a few v_models and mess around!
			"attach_to_hands"			"2"														// [Use w/v, or c?]		[!] How should this weapon use its models? Set this to "1" for Live TF2 c_models, or "2" for TF2C w/v_models. Most TF2C weapons SHOULD be "2", for the extra versatility allowed.
			"used_by_classes"																	// [Used by Class]		[!] Who's able to equip this? For a class that can equip this, it shows up in whatever loadout slot you input earlier. For multi-class weapons, you can set a slot, like "primary" instead of "1", to have that class get it in a different slot!
			{

				{
					"attribute_class"	"DISPLAY_ONLY"											// A stat "function" is what a stat actually does, influenced slightly by how numbers are handled by "name"! An empty or invalid function field, like here, means it does nothing - useful for text you just want to show and never do anything else.
					"value"				"25"													// A stat "value", lastly, is a modifier for whatever your stat actually does. Depending on if this is read as "additive" or "percentage" by the name field from earlier, you may need to change this!

// (ID 3320~3329) |	Conscientious Objector		|	Tags: (v1.7.5), (Old), (AllClass), (Melee), (Utility), (Weapon)							|	Extra: (Scout), (Soldier), (Pyro), (Demoman), (Heavy), (Engineer), (Medic), (Sniper), (Spy), (Civilian)
//-----
// [Authors: Valve (Assets, "Team Fortress 2" https://store.steampowered.com/app/440)]
// [Overview: A Stock Reskin, but with very slightly extra poking range.]
//
// A strange weapon to bring back, but it came from a place of (trying) to implement having your own spray as a decal on the weapon! Failing that, of course, I ended up making an entire "custom decal" system just for it...
// That aside though, it's certainly a strange weapon. Later on, I gave it very slightly longer range, as a sort of option for classes that don't natively have a longer-range weapon! Not... super, interesting, but it's fine. Maybe...
// This was largely for everyone except for Spy, who had... unique, problems. Accordingly, the range is a lot smaller for his Objector, and he later got a surprise inclusion...!
//
// Other Notes:
// Original Weapon ID was (3390 ~ 3399). Moved to AllClass Reskins section.
// If you want to use custom decals, extract "custom_objector_decals_go_here!" from the Mod Install into your custom folder, and edit the "decal_team.vtf" files within! More details in a text file there.

// The first actual weapon! Let's get crackin'! I decided I wanted to bring the Shortstop back, first, since Scout has really been missing... much of anything to use. And, since I've already made this once before in my old videos, this is a natural next-step!
// Though... not without some growing pains along the way, unfortunately. Given how... uniquely, scuffed this weapon is, it swapped back and forth between being based on a Pistol, then a Revolver, then Nailgun, and finally just, no bullshit, just a Scattergun.
// And, as far as how it works, it's just a very no-shenanigans version of Live's Shortstop (the old one), just a good mid-range option in your usually close-range toolkit. Importantly, with the old reload speed, and even some of the new perks! No shove, though. You've got another gun for that!

// [Overview: Scout - A Shotgun that provides increased mobility and disrupts enemy movement!]
//
// A two-parter for my old, returning weapons, is Scout's iconic double-barrel scattergun with more recoil than he or the enemy can handle, the Force-a-Nature! I've always really, really liked the way it felt to fire this gun, so naturally I wanted to bring it back ASAP, too!
// At first, though, all it had to its name was the damage-dealing parts. No knockback, whatsoever. It made it a bit disappointing to shoot and not get any mobility or enemy-bothering ability out of it, but luckily, both of these got added back with future TF2C updates, so it finally works as intended!
// With surprisingly little fuss, too - the original really already is a heavily-mangled scattergun. So, for better or worse, your favorite neighborhood double-barrel is back in town to send dumbasses off cliffs and you to the safe clutches of the nearest medkit! As it was meant to be.

// [Overview: Engineer - A Revolver! It's a stock weapon. It does more damage, with a slower firing speed and less ammo than the Pistol.]
//
// Start dancin', boy. Engineer finally lands his hands on a Revolver! Not a fake one, either, or just a glorified pistol (technically) - a REAL revolver! I've been wanting this for a very long time, so let's get to it!
// Mechanically, though, not much to say. It's functionally identical to Spy's revolver. This doesn't feel too broken, IMO, since it has so little reserve ammo - a resource Engineer usually uniquely has an excess of.
// Since this is, sorta, a "stock weapon", this acts as a basis for other revolvers Engineer gets, if any! Really, all there is to it.
//
// Other Notes:
// Stock Weapon for the purposes of other weapons.

// The elephant in the room, is TF2C just doesn't have anything even similar to work off of, for the Baseball mechanic. At first, I tried to just forgo that, and it was a regular baseball bat that just tranq'd on hit. Boring. Then, it tranq'd and minicrit! Scary!
// Then, it became a bat that deflected projectiles. This... was, actually interesting! So, for the time being, at least until they add some sort of alt-fire projectile melee, I think I'll stick with this! It's a little rough, as it is right now, but I think it has promise, and hearkens back to prototypes of the Sandman...

// Well? You aren't being paid to stand around, get yourself and your lackadaisical team MOVING, SOLDIER!! This weapon was an interesting challenge to bring into TF2C, considering how relatively unique its effect of speedboosting even worked!
// I wanted to tackle it being a variant of the Umbrella, for Soldier; it makes a single ally at a time faster! And, as of writing, yourself too! Sadly, can't really modify the cooldowns, but it is what it is.
// While I'm fairly happy with this interpretation, if they ever add proper addcond on ally hit stuff, then I'll most likely split this! And, Civ may have a new toy on the horizon... only if.

//
// I love Nailguns. Let's try an unconventional one! I was wanting to bring back the STEN from TF2C B4 in some form, and after some meandering, it ended up as an idea for Sniper! Initially, this was a nailgun... and it still is! For now!
// As far as what the nails did? It used to be a bleed nailgun for a long time... you can imagine that wasn't very good. Eventually, I settled on making it a equalizer-esque tool - it gets more potent as your health dwindles. Use it to help push through bad spots, get enemies off of you, and escape! You'll live another day, mate.

//
// Why settle for less, when you could settle for more... bullets, that is. While a bit of an odd, and admittedly overly simplistic pick to bring back, the Family Biz returns with everything it has to its name... a family of higher clipsize, firerate, and lower damage.
// Admittedly, there's just not too much to be said, it's servicable. It may help slightly in situations where you need to get damage of any kind out faster in an emergency, but it's really up to you which you prefer! But, I've always been one for speed, so it has a small place in my heart.

// The favorite flavor of many of the world's deadliest strongmen (and also the not-so-strong men), Dalokohs returns... perhaps funded under wraps by a certain oil baron? Well, it matters little, what matters is that your favorite chocolate bar is shockingly back!
// It's been... difficult... finding a good niche for this, Live TF2's variant is surprisingly difficult to re-create. I've tried numerous iterations, between just a plain health increase, to having everything overheal you while held, and was debating even worse, but settled on this approach...!
// As it is now, it takes advantage of the ability to "critboost" sandviches and have them heal 3x as much per bite, so this does that manually! You, of course, need to recharge, but the ability to supercharge your own health - just as it was in Live - is something to consider before wading into the thick of battle!

// So, for its return to my new weapons pack, I wanted it to still do the same thing - but now with more accurate flares! Take to the skies, and ALSO light people on fire and annoy them, just as the Gods (me~) intended!

//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (3:2 New/Old). Adds Kill-Icons]
//
// A new TF2C update calls for a new weapons pack update to match! Truthfully, though, this update sorta came out of nowhere a bit sooner than I expected, so sadly I don't have too much weapons-wise for ya. The ideas I do have are pretty experimental, though!
// But, hey, that's not all, at least! I wanted to take these weapons' authenticity up a level, so what better way than to FINALLY add killicons! Yep, that's right, new icons for everything I've made thus far! It took a bit of doing, but I think I figured out a pretty good way to make 'em in the style of TF2C!
// Paired with these backpack icons I've been doing, and more of my new material and model changes, I hope these push a little closer to being "TF2C quality", silly as my weapons may be! I was already goin' for that, but hopefully it feels even MORE authentic!! Okay, have fun, and kill lots and lots for me~!

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench that excels at upgrading things FAST, but has abysmal metal recovery. Also hits harder.]
//
// Another case of "bit-off-more-than-I-could-chew", it's the Eureka Effect! Originally, this was a wrench that "teleported" metal over to your buildings when hitting other people with it. It worked just about as well as that sounds it did.
// Unlike the S. Hospitality, though, this was in a... let's say, scuffed spot to recreate in TF2C. There's nothing else I can really even do that has any vague relation to "teleporting", so I had to hit the drawing board. I almost scrapped it.
// EVENTUALLY, I came up with a brief stopgap - recreating the wrench's ability to quickly get things built up near Spawn and then switching to another wrench! Scuffed, but it'll do until I can invent an AOE Repair-Pulse wrench or Radius Wrench or something...!

// [Overview: A Shotgun that rewards quick reaction and skilled airshots with bonus damage, but with much worse sustain! Pyro can use it, too.]
//
// An old classic, the Reserve Shooter shoots for the sky aiming for people dumb enough to be in YOUR airspace! Teach 'em what's what with a 12-gauge full of FREEDOM! And possibly gasoline.
// This weapon is, essentially, identical to how it works in Live nowadays, and there's certainly no reason to change it - it's simple, effective, and reasonable for everyone involved! Mostly~
// Pyro does get some extra bonuses since airblast is tricky to get much damage with. This also used to be an HP shotgun in the past... maybe I'll revisit that...

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 19 Weapons! (12:7 New/Old). Adds Response Rules. Adds LoDs globally]
//
// Finally, a new TF2C update appears! And, with it, a new weapons pack update! Lucky you~ As always, though, there's a lotta sleek new toys for y'all to mess around with, and this time, some even come with custom voice responses, just like the regular weapons in TF2C! I was debating for a long time whether or not to edit these, but decided it was worth it for the ~immersion~!
// I also took the time to do a lot - and I mean, a LOT of rebalances for most of the weapons! I'm sure you can tell by now that balance... isn't, exactly one of my strong-suits, but I'm still gonna try, at least. I'm thankful all of you took the time to give me advice about things to change, and want to make the weapons as fun to play with as they are to make!
// I have big, big plans for the next update, and hope to see y'all when TF2C v2.1.0 finally appears! I've had a lot of exciting things I want to show y'all soon, but until then! Well, what are ya waitin' for!? Kick some ass, and shoot some lead!

//
// To be entirely honest, I had the idea of making a Nailgun for Engi, and sorta just rolled from here, ha... it's, servicable. I do struggle a lot trying to figure out what to do with this, but eventually settled on... this!
// Compared to Engi's other weapons, it's got vicious burst-damage potential, as well as being, well, a Nailgun - good for building and destroying (people). A solid weapon for mid-range combat - but resource intensive and inaccurate!
// That's it, I suppose, haha... I'd love to make more Nailguns, had I the inspiration, and importantly... more models for it. Ah well, c'est life!

// [Overview: A Shotgun that has shoots many low-damage inaccurate pellets, with a theoretically higher damage!]
//
// The Panic Attack is a real finnicky beastie. I'm sure I don't have to remind you it changed basically every week after they added it for a good while. So, since that has so much weird backend going on, let's try something simple!
// None of the weird reload or dynamic accuracy stuff is here, so I decided to just make it... flat less accurate in general. No reload gimmicks, no accuracy gimmicks past that. It works... fine!
// All said, though, not much of a special niche, I suppose - it's a slightly better shotgun in certain circumstances, but not by THAT much. At least it's easier to understand, now.

// For those times an enemy is (annoyingly) hovering just outside of your range and you really need some way to get them to approach or flee... up the ante a little, with a shotgun that has less spread! This is a simple, but effective, little tool for your arsenel.
// Initially, this began as a Heavy shotgun, and I was flirting with the idea of just having it unconditionally do more damage, but that's... not terribly interesting. So, how about giving it more bullets and making those somewhat more accurate! I suppose Pyro can have it, too, they've been a good [censored]~

// I've always had a particular interest in how subtle CBast's Touhou-themed weapons were - in that they were so incredibly subtle a non-Touhou fan might not even register! This is one such, and while I wanted to make it a tiny bit more obvious, I wanted to keep to that theme.
// That aside, stats wise... a mess. I may yet come back to this yet again later, but I'm quite partial to the idea of a life-stealing knife that harms you if you dare to hold it out - which I think works fair enough right now!
// In the future (and as was my original plan), I may see if I can get bleed-lifesteal to work... maybe using the Beacon's mechanics? We'll see. The night is young, after all...

// As far as what it actually did, though, I never particularly knew what to do with it until relatively recently. It began as a reskin, later turning into an odd "less pellets higher damage" deal, and finally, to this iteration! You start with low-ish ammo, but incrementally get more and more with more kills!
// By default, it starts quite a bit weaker than the default Scattergun, but increases to a comical amount of ammo after just a few kills! Your low damage and slower reload is an ever-present facet of this weapon, though, so pick the right times to run in and unload one, two, three, four, and five shots into your unsuspecting enemies!

// [Update Log: Adds 32 Weapons! (14:18 New/Old). Adds texture mipmaps globally. Updates Kill-Icons to use hooks]
//
// Well, this has been a long time coming, but after so, so long, the Big Update is here! For NOWP, that is. While TF2C v2.1.0 takes its sweet time to appear, I think it really is due time I show y'all what I've been working on for this long...!!
// This is, by far, the biggest update I've ever made for any of my mods, by a LONG shot! Dozens of new weapons, too many balance changes, new responses, cleanup and polish all-around, and even more, all with the goal of making New-Old Weapons Pack the best it can possibly be! So, I really, really do hope that reflects in this update of a lifetime!
// That said... this update cycle sure has been something. Having worked on this for the better part of the year, I think this should be a good spot to leave the mod in for a bit. I hope you all enjoy, and blast eachother to smithereens! Just like I (and K.R. Fawkes) would have intended. Ehehe...

// [Overview: Soldier - A Machinegun to boost your ground AND air mobility, but with very little ammo. Can kill with it if you want!]
//
// A classic returns, familiar to those of you who've played Opposing Force before - the M249 SAW! In typical TF2 fashion, I wanted to exaggerate its qualities - amping up the recoil pushback to 11!
// While the LMG is very strong in its debut game (and most other games for the matter), I wanted to make it a full mobility tool first and foremost. Of course, it's perfectly decent at killing, but use it to course-correct or reach even further with a jump!
// With its very, very low ammo and high spread, though, you'll find yourself hurting for ammo for it quite often! Try giving your ol' Shotgun a whirl, it might still save your life. Otherwise... this is one of my favorite and cleanest weapons I've made. No changes needed!

// Over time, I settled on trying to make it a flamethrower that does more damage, but only situationally. As it is currently, it has a single-target focus and excels at building-busting and VIP-hunting, but suffers when it comes to really causing groups to panic. Or, I hope so.
// Sigh... there's a lot more to do here, but it is what it is! I was briefly spitballing an acid-ball flamethrower... which honestly might be good enough to make its own weapon... hmm~

// [Overview: Scout - An SMG that does tremendous burst-damage, but with dreadfully low ammo and accuracy. See: Nailgun]
//
// Jam out to some catchy tunes, and kill dopes all the while; the CSMG clears some room for itself in the back-pocket of your favorite (or least favorite) boston bruiser! Since a certain masked delinquent isn't using it, may as well give it to the next best (or worst) person!
// For no particular reason, I just really liked the CSMG, so decided to bring it back for a sort of "OF Weapons Mini-Pack" that I'd use in my TDM_ map conversions! That... didn't really pan out. But, I salvaged this (and the Brimstone!), and gave them a sort of new lease on life.
// Now, it's a particularly powerful secondary SMG for Scout! Its sheer strength and speed is cut, however, by its absolutely abysmal accuracy and ammo capacity. Run up close, and aim well, you can dish out the hurt quickly, but once you're out of ammo, so can they. Fill 'em with miami lead, quick!

// That's not all it has going for it, though - nails, as a base property of theirs, have quite good damage even at mid-range, so this means that this minigun is unusually good at a slightly further out range than Heavy's usual fare!

// [Overview: Engineer - A PDA that makes Dispensers and Teleporters build and act VERY fast, but with dramatically low defenses.]
//
// Hoo, this is a doozy. This PDA is, in short, a supercharged Gunslinger, or maybe a Mini-Buildings PDA as a whole. Just like how the Gunslinger deploys faster, weaker sentries, this is intended to deploy faster, weaker buildings in general.
// As one could guess due to this being, well, all of them at once, it effectively has three entire weapons' worth of internals to wrangle with!! As a result, though, it makes a hyper-offense focused Engineer toolkit. Build fast, think fast, move fast.
// This item... I'll be honest is likely to get instantly obliterated into like 2-3 sub-weapons come the removal of custom PDAs, which I'm not looking forward to, but is a reality that's getting closer!! Hoo boy!
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Dispensers and Teleporters build fast.
// Buildings have 127 HP (from 150). Buildings can't be upgraded. Dispenser + Teleporter cost 30% less metal to build (130 70 35)
// Dispenser generates surplus metal and do more healing. Teleporter builds as fast as a Jump Pad
// When combined with the split variant, Buildings have 82 HP (from 150), Build Cost is reduced, etc

// [Overview: Engineer - A SBL that shoots a Dispenser landmine, to defend a single area at a time. See: Mine Layer, Explosive Dispenser]
//
// One day, I was hazily taking a shower at like 2 AM, and suddenly, the words "The Dispenserizer" appeared in my head. Rapt by this, I knew immediately I had to fully realize that this even entailed. A manic night ensued, but sure enough, at the end... was the Dispenserizer.
// That aside, I had been toying previously with the idea of area landmines that acted more as deterrents or detection tools. So, in a strange twist of fate, this became a realization of that concept! A diet mine-layer for Engineer, essentially.
// Engi can deter people off of any one flank of his choice, or at least know people are coming! Powerful as it is, it replaces his Shotgun (now, anyway), and doesn't do a horrible amount of damage, so you'd still strictly be better using a Shotgun for direct combat! I hope, anyway.

// Usually, when I make weapons for NOWP, I tend to go look at older versions if I think the new version is too overtuned or overcomplicated. However... looking back, I realize something... I accidentially re-invented the Eviction Notice as the Knux Sandvich!! Stats and all!
// So, I decided to try my hand at bringing back the Live TF2 variant as-is, mostly. Low-damage, and leaves you very vulnerable, but it excels in speed! Quickly jab your enemies in a driveby, and escape before anybody can come chase you n' your boys down!

// I figured it'd be a fun fold to also make it swing faster since it has almost nothing else going for it (crit vs. bleeding is already taken by Fishwhacker, so no-go), and it... works! All said, I think it feels like a servicable, if simple little weapon.
// I really just have strangely fond memories of this as, of course, one of the first Sniper weapons I'd ever gotten, if not one of the first in general. It may be a dinky little wooden knife, but it's memorable to me!! A hand-me-down from a time long passed... -sniffles-

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.3.5 (Update 7, 8/8/2022)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 14 Weapons! (8:6 New/Old)]
//
// Hey! I... wasn't expecting to be back so soon, but no rest for the wicked, I guess! In any case, I've already prepped a bunch of new weapons and a LOT, I mean a LOT of balance changes for y'all! Hopefully this... works?
// ...If I might be blunt, I think the fatigue is starting to set in, I hadn't really even gotten any real rest from last update before I needed to hurry back and push this update to fix the balancing. Which, might I remind you, I'm not stellar at!
// Well, I think THIS time, I've earned a solid break. Thus far I've made 7 entire updates for TF2C v2.0.0 and its patches... and I just want to take a breather for a while, until next update actually decides to release! Think of it as an extended summer vacation! Take a load off and spill some blood, hopefully I'll see y'all soon...!

// [Overview: Demoman - A Melee that's focused on landing fast, consecutive combo hits for extra damage! See: Double Scotch]
//
// Up until now, Demoman's melee slot has been completely swamped in old melees, so how about a new one for a change! I had the idea for this weapon for a long while - a haunted gauntlet Demoman punches with - but it took some time for it to develop fully.
// From the get-go, it was relatively fast-attacking and had increased damage for later hits, but wouldn't really find its footing until I made TF_WEAPON_CYCLOPS_DBL - after which I essentially turned this into a melee Cyclops, hehe.
// It's a little scuffed, but this remains one of my favorite weapons if for no other reason than gamefeel. It just feels nice to use.

// A very, VERY strange and experimental weapon, I wanted to toy with the idea of Spy deploying "decoys" or other distractions. At first, I wanted a Decoy Watch that deploys a model decoy, but that didn't pan out at all.
// So, I got to thinking about various types of decoy devices I could even make. Finally, figured to try this - a sound based one! It's very scuffed, but it's an interesting proof of concept, for now.

Simple upside, simple downside, but it means your average axe swings deal a measly 33 DMG, and 99 against a heal-target!

// A peculiar weapon, the Liberty Launcher makes its appearance! It's quite an odd weapon at first blush, since none of the stats particularly jump out at you... or even seem to work together at all.

// Maybe this should have jumped out at me sooner, ha, considering it's a companion piece to the MG! And it has 5 rockets. And a higher proj. speed. For some reason? For liberty.

// A new challenger arrives on the Pyro Projectile-Launcher scene... it's the (former) Molotov Launcher! This weapon has had a... messy... history, but I think I'm finally happy with where it is currently, so we'll see if that stays.
// My initial ideas were to have it shoot Molotovs that provide a lingering AoE effect, but that... didn't really pan out. I don't think any of us really liked the 4-shot explosive molotovs, either, and it was just so bulky and... y'know what? Back to the drawing board!
// I figured for a rework of this, I wanted to focus more on it being a more general-purpose, faster, easier to use slant on the DF! Fast, low damage, decent splash, and otherwise no special effects. Simple, but feels and looks a lot better than before. We'll see if it needs more spice, soon...!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.5.0 (Update 8, 4/29/2022)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 29 Weapons! (14:16 New/Old). Adds Secret Weapons. Updates items_game to use hooks]
//
// IT'S FINALLY HERE! To match with the monumental occassion of a NEW MAJOR UPDATE, I've assembled one of the biggest updates New-Old Weapons Pack has yet seen, with dozens of new weapons, restored function for old weapons, and so. So much polish. To make this maybe the single best version of NOWP yet!!
// I really can't understate how much of everything changed, everything I could think of to fix, simplify, and overhaul - I did so. I've been planning this update out from as soon as early 2021, even working concurrently with my earlier updates, and always having planned this to be a simple patch to add some goodies for TF2C v2.1.0!
// Well, evidently, things took a little longer than intended, and I had to roll some stuff back into NOWP v2.2.5. But, I think, this is it. The update, as I always meant it to be, is FINALLY OUT!! Paint the badlands red today, boys, you've earned it. Make us proud.

// [Overview: Demoman - A Shield with heavy focus on mobility, w/ weaker properties overall. Since ALL shields in TF2C do this, has 1-2 extra benefits!]
//
// Demoman finally gets a shield! This, initially, was intended to be the Chargin' Targe, but given how TF2C's shields work with their complete turn freedom, I didn't feel it was right to implement it as-is. So, instead of that, I added this!
// This shield existing should be a familiar baseline, although not identical to Live. It doesn't strictly have 'downsides', per-se, but here it acts somewhat as the "default" shield, in a similar role the C. Targe held originally. So, not much special going on.
// Since the charge turning is a property of ALL shields, as of writing, this has a faster recharge time to act as a more readily available mobility option that recharges somewhat fast!
//
// Other Notes:
// Stock Weapon for the purposes of other weapons. Not actually a stock weapon.

// being the TF2 Flamethrower's descendant, I wanted to try my hand at seeing how it'd work with the more updated gameplay of TF2. Instead of flames, it shoots incendiary rockets VERY quickly, and otherwise shares a lot with the modern flamer!
// I wanted to (re-)design it as a sort of in-between for the Flamethrower and the DF... fast, consistent damage with projectiles albeit less capable of sheer crowd control.

// (ID 3496) |	Unused Entry - Helicopter Gun	|	Tags: (Unused)
//-----
// [Overview: Empty, for the time being!]
//
// Other Notes:
// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a fairly long time and was ALMOST confident in releasing, the Helicopter Gun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it applied very weak pushback force onto Heavy to allow him to hover in the air if he shoots directly downward. Offset by extremely low ammo, low dps, and extra fall damage (don't sleep on this it HURTS)
// However, despite my best efforts, there was too much weirdness with all sorts of things like explosives, Jump Pads, and even -water- making Heavy skyrocket into the Skybox. This wasn't something I think people would stomach dealing with...

// [Overview: A Melee that's encourages fighting on or near objectives with better performance, but with some vulns. See: ObjectiveGun]
//
// Pain Train reappears, now also held by its rightful and fightful owner, Pyro! Soldier and Demo keep it, too. A simple weapon, but a bit spicier, now.
// It takes some ideas - or specifically attributes - from the old Objective Gun, and well, isn't overpowered! I hope not, anyway. In general, you fight better if you or the enemy is doing an objective!
// This happens to ALSO work to give Pain Train a reason to work on a lot of gamemodes outside of just control point ones. Who needs to deliver the Intel, when you could go kill, Kill, KILL!!

// Making a Sapper unlock is tricky business; a lot of the properties of what makes a Sapper, "a Sapper", weren't at all controlled by items_game.txt or even the weapon script... it's mostly controlled by objects.txt, the file for buildings!
// That was, up until recently, but even so the only thing that changed was the ability to set a custom view and world model, as well as SOME stats. Still, I felt this was enough to make a simple new Sapper, failing my ideas for a RTR port.
// In principle, though, this DOES replicate part of it still: It drains health INCREDIBLY fast relative to the stock Sapper! Unlike the RTR, though, it's less sturdy, not more. And it even removes itself quickly. Use this to get an Engineer to panic and try to force an opening for attack!

// Admittedly, I mostly made this out of a desire to have a more mobility-focused option for Scout, so I glanced at his arsenel, and there was this! Plus, they recently added gravity-modifiers to feign the jump height stuff, so I went with that! It just works out the real-deal jump modifiers came shortly after.
// Honestly, it's very odd how Scout's "mobility pistol" situation evolved. This weapon didn't even have any bonuses for that at all, yet the PBPP did, and then didn't! Ah, well. What works... works?

// My Fists of Steel, they are (still) made of steel! Or, perhaps "thin aluminum", in the presence of other melees. In any case, the oddly-defensive gauntlets, and bane of Snipers everywhere, makes its re-debut, just as noisy as ever!
// These are a little more general than Live's variant. Where in Live, this has a laundry list of downsides, you'll just straight up take crits from melees. Not great!

// This may or may not need the extra nerfs to return, it's hard to say. I think, for now though, this is perfectly servicable, comically loud, and guaranteed to make the nearest non-human Sniper short-circuit and explode just at the sight of you! Now that's quality.

// Since the speed-with-total-charge stat doesn't exist, this one temporarily and incrementally boosts your übercharge rate by a small amount on every hit, up to some total, for 6s! To suit this, it keeps the damage penalty and gets slower firing, too...
// It's interesting, if perhaps a bit strong in its utility. If I'm able, I'd love to return the original Overdose, and then split this into a new syringe gun~ Until then, this is just -drumrolls- a prototype...!!

// A simple gun with a not-so-simple name, L'Étranger appears (and disappears!) - Just like in Live, this fancy lil' revolver is all about increasing your cloak efficiency and upkeep at the cost of very poor damage. Which is fine, your most dangerous tool is already in your suit pocket!
// Simple gun, simple role. Not much else to say. There is... ONE note - this applies cloak drain bonuses even to any watch you have, so it has... interesting interactions. This seems intentional, so I'm keeping it this way, but it's something to remember before you slink off to the shadows.

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench-thing that deploys fast-building, weaker sentries. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is the Gunslinger! It doesn't visually look like it is, but it will be later. This weapon emerged from very odd circumstances - the PDA: Rush Order was getting EXTREMELY crowded, and unfortunately, I had to split it.
// This effectively acts as one-half of it, and acts similarly to how the Live TF2 variant does - it deploys a faster-building and acting Sentry Gun! And has some other weird bonuses and negatives. It's very weird. I can't promise it'll get less weird...
// When the time comes - either be it the removal of custom PDAs or a way I can port the Gunslinger model in without looking fucked up - I'll most likely do even more things to this. Stay tuned...!?
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Sentries build fast.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50)
// Sentry behaves a-la Mini Sentry in Live TF2 (faster firerate, turn rate, but less damage, knockback)

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.7.5 (Update 10, 9/7/2023)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (8:3 New/Old). Adds custom particles]
//
// It's the moment you've all been waiting for... for both TF2C, and NOWP! It was a long wait, but hopefully worth it - I started work on this update (and even the previous one, NOWP v2.6.5!) with anticipation for TF2C v2.1.2's features, and it's finally here!
// To start, I wanted to try making a lot of new, inventive weapons, this time - weapons I don't usually make variants for! On top of that, I wanted to really push QoL to the next level in a way I haven't done in some time. How? Well, new particles for EVERYTHING, new supplemental mods like dropped mags and shells, and more fixes than I can count!!
// It's been a while, but I really am happy with how this update turned out, despite everything. My goal has always been to make these silly things with a level of quality on-par with Eminoma / TF2C Team's own efforts for TF2C, and I think I'm just about there... finally... But, enough about me. Stop gawkin', and start killin'!

// [Overview: Sniper - A Bow for dealing with groups in the mid-range, but without as much sheer stopping power. Fire quickly to keep momentum!]
//
// About time I made a new bow! This started as an optimistic delve into a new weapon type for me, and completely devolved into a weird mess of realizing Bows are... like, 90% hardcoded! Dammit.
// Eventually, though, I made... honestly probably one of the only bows I -could- make. Since one of the few things you can even do with Huntsman-likes is just changing fire-speed, this one has faster speeds as a lynchpin that everything else builds on!
// It's... servicable. There may be a lot going on with this particular bow, but it's because none of them can really carry the bow on their own, so together they join forces to create... a bow that's marginally more scuffed! Hooray!

//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 3 Weapons! (2:1 New/Old)]
//
// Merry Australian Smisskwanzukkah! To celeberate this momentous occassion (and also a new TF2C update), I've made a handful of gifts for the road! No, shh, they're not "weapons", they're "gifts"! (What, are you trying to get me in trouble with Homeland Security??)
// Alongside the new weapons are even more QoL changes, like bloodied weapons on crit-kills, and FINALLY fixing that stupid Medigun beam bug after months of work (no thanks to a certain server), so hopefully NOWP will finally be... okay, hhh, look, I need to level with you for a moment.
// I'm so, so tired. It's thankless work, and having to play fix-up because somebody else can't be bothered to properly maintain their own work has been getting increasingly frustrating to me. I need a break, for a long time. I'll be back, don't worry, but I need some time. Take care, and have fun...!

// All said, though, it's a simple defensive shield. You can still charge, and doing so raises your defenses even higher momentarily. Servicable!

// Welcome back! I missed y'all, and this time I have the biggest update in, shoot, a while! All this time off meant I had a lot of time to reflect, but also a lot of time to put polish and effort into making these again! Not that I wasn't before, but I think you can tell the last few were a little bit rushed, haa...
// This time, everybody gets a new toy or gadget to play with, the QoL is as high as it's ever been, and the balancing! Well, I still suck at balancing, but I've made an effort to rebalance almost everything slightly! This update, for the first time in a long time, has a little bit of everything!
// I'm happy with it, I really am. But, I've gotten to thinking about the longevity of New-Old Weapons Pack, and I don't want it to grow forever like certain other projects. So, I think it's time I think about closure, soon...! But, not quite yet. So, while you still have little ol' me here, maim some people and make me happy!

//
// The LnL returns, this time with two barrels, just as the Queen always intended! Surprisingly late addition for NOWP, but I felt I finally cleaned up enough space to fit a niche in for it - the same one it currently has in Live!
// While, as a pattern, I tend to bring back the older, stronger variants of Live weapons if possible, I decided to stick with the new one, this time, if only because Demoman in NOWP already has... so, so many does-damage-good type GL's.
// Figured out none of them, for their damage capabilities, really are incredible at dealing with buildings on their own, so I decided to bring this back! And fix some longstanding bugs, as usual, hehe.

// I felt inspired, by Engineer's buildings also having miniguns, a variety of mods existing to give Heavy some, and an old quote, to bring this to life. To quote a veteran member of our own GRN team; "Congratulations! You are now my new Sentry."
// All said, though, it's a very loose imagining of it, with some influence from the Wrangler, TF2C B4's increasing-firerate chaingun, and some scrapped ideas of mine, it's a Minigun that situationally fires faster if you're at low health! At full health, it's not much better at all vs. Stock,
// but when the going gets tough, you bet your enemies will all but explode into gibs! But, so will you, if you aren't careful. Paired with your very volatile ammo situation, plan ahead and throw yourself into combat in close quarters, maybe you'll do Engineer proud and walk away with some kills under your belt!

// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (5:0 New/Old)]
//
// Do you hear those ominous bells tolling? Eh, probably nothing to worry about -- look, it's another update! The second to last! I was debating whether or not to just put everything into my last-last update, later this year, but decided I wanted to accompany a TF2C major update, just one more time. Once more, for the road, a minor update!
// Another patch, another set of new toys for ya. Admittedly, I was hoping to make more for this middle-update, but I just need more time and content for the remainder of my ideas! But, you'll see the last of my big ideas, with any luck, soon enough. Hang in there, we're almost done...! Until then, I'll knuckle down for y'all, and get a-crackin' for a last update y'all deserve and can be happy with!
// And, until then, I'll... think about what I want to do after. Even now, I don't want to entirely give up, but I'm determined next time will be the last major update with y'all. Maybe, just maybe, I'll release smaller patches onto it. Small surprises to accompany my completed masterwork... ehe... one can dream. But, otherwise... ciao, for now. 'Till we meet again... friends. See you soon.

// As it turns out, just ONE weapon type works for my purposes, and that also has a shield mechanic, so I thought - instead of completely ignoring that, how about we use every part of this beefy business and see where we end up!?

// [Overview: Engineer - A Melee that hits continuously, and excels at repairing and upgrading in small, steady increments! Suffers with burst-damage.]
//
// Well, well, weld, if it isn't an old-fashioned welder (or blowtorch!) This idea's been everpresent for some time, whether very early in TF2's development or with community ideas, but I wanted to see how I could get such a strange concept to work - so I got crackin'!
// Generally speaking, most people either make it a secondary pistol-replacement that uses metal as ammo to heal buildings, which I both can't do and dislike, or they just have it be a regular melee like any other Wrench, but it ignites now! But, I'd seen very few recreations really tackle how something like this'd work.
// Eventually, I settled for this strange variant - a very fast, rapidly firing melee that continually heals buildings. Great for healing off small increments, like from chip damage or ammo drain, but baaaad at dealing with burst from Engi's normal foes. For now, it works, but we'll have to see how it turns out! Strap on your Hotrods, boys, we've got a heap of weldin' to do!

// May have guessed it, but this originally started life as an Iron Bomber rework. See, the IB has a stat that makes its pipes essentially stop moving once it hits the ground. That's an incredibly cool and unique feature, and one some people make use of - but not many, sadly. A lot of people tend to just use the IB like Stock, with different properties, and completely forget or forego the entire gimmick there.
// I wanted to really try making a GL that actually, really focuses in on those stationary pipebombs, since IB doesn't really use it in a meaningful way. The result? An odd lil' hybrid between the GL and SBL - fire on congested areas or cover your escape, and your bombs explode with a fair delay in the exact spot you laid them! Your enemies and allies alike will scratch their heads figuring out what is and isn't a pipebomb, anymore!

// However, a big catch takes a long time to reel in. Most of the weapon's actions - firing, charging, and even the harpoon itself are quite slow, so quickscopes aren't too great. Instead, why not set up shop, wait a while down a narrow sightline or for clusters of enemies, and charge all the way for a clean, clean catch? Ahh, they'll be fresh shrimp on the barbie.

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL for comboing by aiming well to keep the damage comin'! See: B4 Cyclops, Pillstreak concept]
//
// Initially drafted by Kris, this weapon went through quite many iterations, before I settled on something that, surprisingly, worked! In its current iteration, this takes some scrapped TF2C concepts and turns it into a single weapon!
// The "combo" mechanic was, admittedly, a huge pain to figure out, but I remain startled at how well it works! I still have work to do on this thing yet - especially if they add either of the two scrapped concept weapons it's based on, finally, but for now, this should do!
// Despite the original prerelease Cyclops in TF2C being a little flat, I think this gives it a bit of identity! Big rewards, but upkeep issues if you can't consistently land hits.

// Take after the same minds that took us to the stars, and soar through the skies (and back) with the power of rockets... and extremely explosive rocket fuel! One of the newest (and weirdest) recent TF2 weapons returns, this time simplified!
// Obviously, the Thermal Thruster is a very complicated weapon in Live, so I - with inspiration from TF2 Un-Classic - wanted to see if we couldn't simplify it slightly so it even works in TF2C. The result? A quick, and importantly immediate burst of mobility for yourself on attack!
// The means to get to this end were very... nightmarish... in the past, but it's mostly been simplified - at least kinda. I think it works well enough for its niche, while also being a bit less gimmicky than it is in Live.

//
// An odd little inclusion, but one I was wanting for some time! There do exist mods for this sort of thing - but I decided making a weapon to help my training efforts would be good! Plus, Demoman has more usable options for Secondary now, so it's worth a go!
// The timing specifically was one aspect of grenade jumps that I always had difficulty with, so hopefully this proves helpful. I've discovered these are VERY powerful jumps and shouldn't be slept on!
// This DOES mean Demoman has 2 Jumpers now, though. Teehee. Now to invent a Bottle Jumper! Caber Jumper? Hmm...

Not even the health on kill stat applying to ever weapon. So, back to the drawing board!
// Kiri kinda made the design of this for me. A really short, but extreme speed boost watch. Get hit while cloaked or uncloak early? Too bad, it's all gone! It doesn't recharge on it's own, so you need to kill people or pickup ammo boxes to refill it.

// [Overview: Engineer - An arm augmentation that increases mobility by flinging yourself forward when you punch, and minicrits with successive hits. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is *a* Gunslinger! Instead of just buffing your health and providing a mini combat sentry, it instead buffs your health, provides extra mobility, and more damage with multiple hits in a row, at the cost of weaker and level limited buildings. This'll let you get a sentry up in a spot you wouldn't normally be able to, 
// but don't expect to be able to maintain it against direct fire! Could also be useful for retreating, or being a real gun slinger and being right up in the fray!
// The Sentry does less damage, but not as less as the PDQ or Gunslinger.
//
// Other Notes:
// Punching people sets them on fire for a second, the afterburn doesn't deal any damage. Hitting burning targets does minicrit damage. This was done to somewhat replicate Live TF2's Gunslinger's niche but unique 3-hit combo mechanic.
// Upgrading is slowed down by a bit. You only get to spend 20 metal instead of 25, meaning you have to hit a building 10 times to upgrade it, down from the 8 times wit the Stock Wrench.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50). It doesn't give you a mini-sentry tho.
// When combined with the jump pad, you get to absolutely FLY across maps!
// You'll take minicrits from projectiles while in the air, so watch out for that!

//
// A new SMG, but for the Pyro! Admittedly, this weapon came somewhat from a spot of self-indulgence, and probably isn't really damage centered, but it makes me happy, dangit!
// It's a basic SMG, not too much to it, all aside. Higher clip, lower reserve, minicrits against burning targets, and more damage overall! The main downside, which isn't listed, is that it's not a shotgun or a flaregun.

// Other Notes:
// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a long while and was nearly confident in releasing, A bolt launcher + nailgun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it would shoot fast moving, large hitbox, high damage bolts. Offset by extremely low ammo, low fire rate, and extra low clip size.
// However, despite my best efforts, this thing has become an exercise in "I can't understand what stats I need to use to make this feel right and not become useless."

// [Overview: A GL for practicing the ins-and-outs of Brick Jumping! Completely harmless, does almost no damage. Weakest TF2C weapon. See: Brick, Valve Rocket Launcher]
//
// Whoa, what's that? A new training weapon!? Don't mind if I do! Straight from the vaults of the K.R. Fawkes Arms Dealership itself, it's the Ultimate Jumper! The last "Jumper" you'll ever need, it's powered by the most powerful explosives known to man... concrete bricks. You'll be the master of the lost art of Brick Jumping in no time!
// What's that, you want to hear about it's combat abilities? Sorry, I don't have anything to say, it's easily the weakest TF2C weapon there is. Just, absolutely pitiful. Don't even try using it against enemies, what ever will they think of you!? If not for the Brick Jumping, who would EVER want to use a weapon like this!?
// It's just so, so pitifully weak, so weak that Mr. Fawkes himself sealed it away inside 23 separate vaults, all booby-trapped with metric tons of high explosives. Please, just stop thinking of it as a weapon. It's just a training tool, and we promise that it won't eviscerate everybody in front of you - including yourself! H-hey, wait, where are you going!? Sir? Madame!? That'll be $1.49!!

// Max's gun from the Sam & Max games returns! It's still more or less a simple reskin, here, but I did want to add some quality of life that I had always been annoyed hadn't been in the original collab appearance in TF2! The joys of having your own weapons pack~
// Among other things - it actually animates properly! The slide and mag actually move now, finally. And, after quite a lot of digging, it makes the sounds from the original games, too! Minor stuff, all things considered, but it was annoying me for ages... ha...
// All there is to say, really, simple reskin I've finally gotten to fix up! Don't ask where I got it from, or where the mercs keep it.

//
// Other Notes:
// This huge lot of empty entries belonged to the Brickhouse Beatdown - throwable bricks for all classes!! Evidently a joke weapon, but one I love dearly~
// I... admittedly wasn't expecting to ever have to move this. But, it seems like, against all odds, there's an official brick now. I seriously woulda never expected THAT!
// Even if it's only for one class, Scout, I decided to move all of them for consistency. Man, talk about a change. From a joke weapon, to official (in some capacity). That's wild.

// [Overview: A pair of Fists that fire faster and do less damage. Unremarkable... except everyone can use it!]
//
// When out of options, pull out the classic one-two! Initially, I was planning this as either a Soldier-only (Beserk) or Demoman-only (Drunken Fist) weapon, but eventually became allclass, for the same reason the Brick did, hehe.
// Heck, over time, even Heavy and Spy recieved it - the two classes that didn't have it to begin with. So, it really is an all-class one! Initially, I wrote this off as a joke, but enough of y'all used it to warrant me making the stats visible again~
// All said, it's just your basic emergency option. Why spend money on a weapon you have to lug around, when you can use the two big guns you're already using to bash, slash, and mash people with on the daily!

// Ahh, the Skullbuster. This weapon and I go quite a ways back to before I even knew how to mod. It was one of the first mods I'd used as a kid, and I ended up making a revamped version of it... because SOME people on the workshop though it'd be cool to make a new version and NOT release it! Thanks, TF2 Workshoppers.
// That aside, I thought it would be cute - if a bit dumb looking - to have this finally make it into the Weapons Pack after all these years. I think it deserves the spot, although I'm starting to regret it since he won't shut up. Do you still have the shovel I gave you?

// [Overview: Scout - A Shotgun that fires and reloads fast, and has better performance at mid-range! See: PSO2 Rifle, PSU Shotgun]
//
// A bit of a self-fulfillment weapon, hehe, this is an approximate recreation of a weapon of the same name in a game I quite like! No illusions about it being usable, so secret weapon it goes.
// That aside, though, I tried to have it fill the same general niche as the original weapon, a crowd-control tool that's fairly good at medium range and gets a lot of damage out without really needing to stop!
// Obviously, the design principles in a third-person action game and a first-person shooter are, uh, different. So, things might be a bit scuffed~ Not that I mind, though.

// Well, you're in luck! A mixup at the Bonesaw Factory and the Syringe Factory created a somehow-familiar looking weapon... a fearsome looking saw with a blade and syringe to match, we'll call it... "The Übersaw". And it could be yours, for a low, low payment of $4.99!
// (Okay, for a serious summary - I just like the old Übersaw, and wanted to have it back. It has the old stats, if you want those! But, it makes little difference, an übersaw's an überspritze's an über-weapon! Saw through their bones like it's 2008!)

// [Overview: Heavy - An AAGun that quickly fires lower-damage rockets across an area, for limited area control and splash damage! Also gives mobility! See: AA Cannon, Minigun]
//
// When TF2C team pushed TF2C's first official release, Death & Taxes, it also included were a few very, very interesting remnants of scrapped content and weapons. The AA Gun was one of them... and I've attempted to re-create it! With some creative liberties, of course~
// Originally, it was some sort of "Minigun" with a much more limited clipsize that shot explosives of... some, kind. Heavy can also blast jump with it by default! So, that's cool! I decided to fold all of these into my new iteration of it, so hopefully it's fun to mess with!
// To my surprise... they decided to finally, actually re-visit the AAGun idea, and officially released it the next update! So, not wanting to totally remove this, I gave this an honorary Vintage quality, and reworked it to be a might faster-firing variant! Complete with blast jump... it's important to the LORE.

//-----
// The first attempt at the ham shank has a lot of jank involved attemping... a lot, to say the least, to emulate a normal melee.
// This is an attempt to embrace the weirdness of the weapon in a way that's easier to understand for players and easier to develop.
// This is still just a brimstone launcher at its core, but changed to somewhat fit melee combat and with display stats relative to that of stock melee.
// A lot of stats are kept from the initial version, with a few notbale differences to it:
// Fires explosive bricks, no explosion radius, with the ham model and a REALLY short fuse time.
// No jank with how it fires - it just shoots instantly. (Similar to the shark)

// Ngl, this is just to use the gun model. Adding supporting sandviches to this civ's gameplay seemed like an interesting direction for this to go in.
// Civ, of course, can't normally use sandviches as a boosting option. However, adding it in this way opens up the door for that. My limited options for sandviches do limit the idea somewhat though.
// Yep, that's all I have to say for this one. Compared to what i've already done, this is basically nothing. Most complicated thing here is the chocolate bar's model edit.
// I've definately improved a lot at this (at least on a technical level) since I started haven't I?
// Make no mistake though, there's still a lot I don't understand about all of this. Plugins scare me, and modeling is not something I am capable of, apperently. Still, i've got maybe the most important part (at least for this kind of mod, I both envy and pity Bigmazi) down.

//-----
// It's no secret that this kind of weapon is really underwhelming, KOCW had this kind of weapon, and only ever saw use when engineer stacking after they introduced an engineer cap there, 
// and it kind of sucked at actually keeping a nest up. Which of course, made it get complained about enough to get nerfed into the ground. This is KOCW we're talking about here. (Eternal skill issue)
// Albiet, maybe it's more useful in VIP mode, but I highly doubt that. Plus, ultimately, it just makes an already overly passive class even more passive.
// So, I thought, what if I let this have some kind of buff? Well, traditional buffs are a bit out of the question, due to how weird that'd be to implement.
// But, I thought that this getting a version of engie's ether spell could be a really good way to make this a lot better and more practical.
// There's no other civ weapons that can give ammo after all. That's  an interesting thing for him to be able to do, and leans into the concept at play here.
// So ya, hopefully this will end up make this more vertsatile, powerful, and interesting. -Clock

// New-Old Weapons Pack! Custom Stats / Attributes
//-----
// [Overview: A set of new stats / attributes, mostly to add custom stat-text but also to fix or tweak some stuff! Everything here's already included in some way in default TF2C!]
//
// At long last, with NOWP v2.5.0, this mod now uses custom attributes!! For the most part, it's mostly used for new text-display, but occasionally also for stat functions! Thanks to azzy, of course, for letting attributes accept plaintext descriptions~!
// Really, as mentioned, I mostly just make use of these to change stat text - be that making new text not present in tf2c_english.txt, or simplifying wording to not be so ridiculously wordy, or even just changing colors around. It's simple work, and NOWP hardly -needs- it per-se, but it helps make it all feel just that bit more official. Really.
// If you're modding New-Old Weapons Pack, or using one of its weapons, it'd probably be best if you copy any relevant attributes from here to your project. The game might fuss, piss itself, cry, and / or die (probably in that order) otherwise, if you don't.
