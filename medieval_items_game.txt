//
// Welcome to the end of the world and my mind!
// In all seriousness, though, this is going to get messy.
// In order for your silly little client to understand what's going on, all of these need to be in one file, NO MATTER WHAT!
// To enable these for private use, just take these files from your downloads folder and put them in your custom folder (i think) you'll need to put it in a new folder for the game to not explode though.
// If you want a "pure" download, download it from github here: 
// If you're here to see how your favourite weapon operates under the hood, buckle up cause you're in for a ride.
// If you're one of the developers that made these packs, double check you're strapped in cause it's going to likely be even worse for you to see how i've butchered your babies.
// These packs are up to date as of 02/03/2025, with the exception of ReValve, because I just want to get this out at this point tbh.
// If you are a weapon maker or modeler featured in this pack and would like to have your models/weapons removed, contact me on discord (@clockstealer) or make an issue on the github page.
// This is the medieval exclusive item schema, which is mostly summed up by "show_in_armory" "0" ing all of the norm item schemas items
// Thought that if I was going to include all of the base maps (except tc_hydro because you can't run bots on that....) then I should make a medieval mode schema, that cleans things up a bit so that you know what you can use! 
// Updating 2 item schemas would just be incredibly tedious and a waste of file space... so linking to the OG file was the way to go for me, even if players loading into medieval would have to download both item schemas.
// Also, due my laziness, i've not fully purged this list of all of the base content schemas items, including some old concepts. I do plan to trim this down more in the future, but for now i'm just gonna be lazy tbh. -Clock

//-------------------------------------------------------------------// For some sense of convenience, I'll try to keep my weapons up in the 3300-4500 ID range. Higher than that, I won't touch - feel free to use those for your own stuff!
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// FUNCTIONALLY though, I should only need like, 3300-4000. 8+ Updates later, and I've only barely scratched up to using maybe 300 total. Still, from now on, I'll do my best to keep in this range. You have my word.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// I'm unsure how other Weapons Packs want to handle it, but having all of our stuff cordoned off into copy-and-pasteable chunks might help quite a bit!
//-- NEW-OLD WEAPONS PACK ITEMS AREA (3300 - 4500)-------------------//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Also, if you're wondering why such a specific number; TF2C v2.0.0 Release had its unlockable items all the way up at about the 3000 range. I figured I'd start mine at 3300 to be safe.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// That's enough for the 10 classes to get 10 official weapons in EVERY weapon slot, including PDAs! Needless to say, that's far more than even Live TF2 ever had (not counting reskins).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------// Granted, later they reverted to having the new items be in the low 32-50's range, so that left a huge amount of space in-between. I'm not moving my weapons closer, so if you want anything that shows up BEFORE my stuff - try there!

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Yakibomb (Crusader's Crossbow)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 40 Weapons! (13:27 New/Old)]
//
// And so, my humble weapons mod turns a new leaf and begins a new stage on its journey! Old friends and subscribers of mine might remember a time a decade ago when I was making all sorts of strange weapons for TF2C's v2.0.0 B4! It was fun then, and my hope is that it'll be fun now!
// In this first update, you'll find many returning items, both from my old projects as well as from regular TF2, and even TF2C's scrapped ideas, but I've made sure to include plenty of brand new toys to play with, too!
// Hopefully, your backpack doesn't feel so bare anymore, haha! I only plan to add more, as I get the ideas, so keep an eye out! And, hopefully, you'll have fun using this all these new weapons to maim eachother with! Have fun!

// [Overview: A Stock Reskin with HL1 flair! Unremarkable as a starting weapon goes.]
//
// In a way, beside literally being the first weapon here, the Crowbar might well be one of my first custom weapons... ever. Its story goes all the way back to the infancy of TF2C, back when the game was little more than 2007 TF2 with a Nailgun.
// I had found an SFM Crowbar in Meet the Medic's files, and wanted to make that a weapon, so I did! I kept pushing for it to be an all-class weapon like in TFC on FP Forums, but kept getting rebuffed. However, it eventually made it onto Mercenary!!
// ...who was later taken away by Class Protective Services. Whee. But, long story short, that meant I was free to just, add it back in, as a REAL all-class item, when the time came to finally make my own bundle of stuff!
//
// Other Notes:
// Since this is the very first weapon, I'll go into detail what tends to go into ANY given custom weapon!
// If you're curious about it, take a gander, otherwise feel free to skim onto the other things further down! Have fun~
// Things marked with [!] are important to have in some form no matter what, so pay extra attention to those!

//
// You know it, you love it - the Frying Pan returns! To be entirely honest with you, this weapon did take a while to appear. Part of the way through the planning phases of the first update, I just, wanted to hit someone with a Frying Pan.
// Of course, given the only weapons back then were the Crowbar, AA Gun, and maybe FAN or Shortstop, I had plenty of room to bring back the Accursed Weapon! And it's certainly nice to have, even if it doesn't really do anything, ha...

// That aside though, it's certainly a strange weapon. Later on, I gave it very slightly longer range, as a sort of option for classes that don't natively have a longer-range weapon! Not... super, interesting, but it's fine. Maybe...
// This was largely for everyone except for Spy, who had... unique, problems. Accordingly, the range is a lot smaller for his Objector, and he later got a surprise inclusion...!
//
// Other Notes:
// Original Weapon ID was (3390 ~ 3399). Moved to AllClass Reskins section.
// If you want to use custom decals, extract "custom_objector_decals_go_here!" from the Mod Install into your custom folder, and edit the "decal_team.vtf" files within! More details in a text file there.

// The first actual weapon! Let's get crackin'! I decided I wanted to bring the Shortstop back, first, since Scout has really been missing... much of anything to use. And, since I've already made this once before in my old videos, this is a natural next-step!
// Though... not without some growing pains along the way, unfortunately. Given how... uniquely, scuffed this weapon is, it swapped back and forth between being based on a Pistol, then a Revolver, then Nailgun, and finally just, no bullshit, just a Scattergun.
// And, as far as how it works, it's just a very no-shenanigans version of Live's Shortstop (the old one), just a good mid-range option in your usually close-range toolkit. Importantly, with the old reload speed, and even some of the new perks! No shove, though. You've got another gun for that!

//
// A two-parter for my old, returning weapons, is Scout's iconic double-barrel scattergun with more recoil than he or the enemy can handle, the Force-a-Nature! I've always really, really liked the way it felt to fire this gun, so naturally I wanted to bring it back ASAP, too!
// At first, though, all it had to its name was the damage-dealing parts. No knockback, whatsoever. It made it a bit disappointing to shoot and not get any mobility or enemy-bothering ability out of it, but luckily, both of these got added back with future TF2C updates, so it finally works as intended!
// With surprisingly little fuss, too - the original really already is a heavily-mangled scattergun. So, for better or worse, your favorite neighborhood double-barrel is back in town to send dumbasses off cliffs and you to the safe clutches of the nearest medkit! As it was meant to be.

// Run, Heavy, run! Forgo your conventional mass murder and minigun-haulin' skills, and get outta dodge, with the GRU! An ever-popular yet oft-controversial tool in Heavy's kit, I figured it'd be interesting to have it return!
// I decided to roll in an older iteration of it... most likely, the one everyone is familiar with. Run fast, but do no damage, and put yourself at great risk while it's active! Simple, but servicable. Get those legs movin', big guy!

// As one of my first throwables - and unknown to me, first of MANY - it's very scuffed, but I think still works... in the broad strokes.

// [Overview: Engineer - A Revolver! It's a stock weapon. It does more damage, with a slower firing speed and less ammo than the Pistol.]
//
// Start dancin', boy. Engineer finally lands his hands on a Revolver! Not a fake one, either, or just a glorified pistol (technically) - a REAL revolver! I've been wanting this for a very long time, so let's get to it!
// Mechanically, though, not much to say. It's functionally identical to Spy's revolver. This doesn't feel too broken, IMO, since it has so little reserve ammo - a resource Engineer usually uniquely has an excess of.
// Since this is, sorta, a "stock weapon", this acts as a basis for other revolvers Engineer gets, if any! Really, all there is to it.

//
// "Why get your hands dirty, when you could just let your folks tear 'em apart like dingos?" - if that's the kinda thinking you aspire by, then this rifle is for you! Stand from afar and help your team out!
// As one of the first rifles I made, and especially given Sniper's already-existing offense-focused arsenel, I wanted to go for a faster-firing, weaker rifle for support purposes. At first, this was just a simple MfD, but over time, it shifted to outlines, then both, then...
// Well, we'll see where it goes. I think I want to keep the outline, but the exact nitty-gritty may change over time!
//--------------------------------------------------
		"3363"																					// The idea with this weapon was to make a "support" Sniper Rifle - where instead of picking off key targets, Sniper "marks" key targets for nearby teammates to go after. The most experimental of the bunch, so this might change in the future.

So, for the time being, at least until they add some sort of alt-fire projectile melee, I think I'll stick with this!

// Heck, and then they added the Brick, which is a very no-nonsense version of the Cleaver. Well, it can't be helped. I suppose what it does right now is sufficient to stand out a bit, even if only so. I'd remove the knockback if I could! But, well... let's say, the brick's blood runs deep, here.

// As it is now, it takes advantage of the ability to "critboost" sandviches and have them heal 3x as much per bite, so this does that manually!

// [Overview: Soldier - A RL that rewards good aim with incredible damage - especially to airborne targets! Extremely scary and busted.]
//
// This weapon needs no introduction - it's probably one of the simplest AND scariest weapons ever made for TF2 (that isn't intentionally trying to be busted). The Direct Hit returns, a mainstay for terrifying Soldier-mains everywhere!
// As will happen... embarassingly often in this wep pack, I am frankly too terrified to touch this. It's simple, but deadly. Those kinds of weapons get a lot, I mean a LOT of scrutiny! And, why fix what... well, it is broken, but something that people love?
// But enough about the META stuff - it works essentially 1-1 to how it does in Live! It rewards good aim! A lot! There's not really a downside, but that's just how it is for some Live stuff...

// a lot of basic amenities didn't exist... least of which, was a Flare Gun or even flare projectile. So, back then, in order to make a Flaregun, it shot rockets! With accompanying HUGE knockback! It was fun to jump around tr_walkway with it, even if it was a little bit jarring.
// So, for its return to my new weapons pack, I wanted it to still do the same thing - but now with more accurate flares! Take to the skies, and ALSO light people on fire and annoy them, just as the Gods (me~) intended!

// As it turns out, it actually shoots tranq darts. And, they don't collide with Engineer at all. So, I had to, totally ditch that idea... and fell back the the default, BORING stats of the original Southern Hospitality.
// It's still a little boring honestly, but it has like absolutely no niche in Live TF2, either. Spycheck-helper, at most? I decided to make it a bit of a utility for helping scrounge up more metal from metal sources, but that's about itttt.

// [Update Log: Adds 5 Weapons! (3:2 New/Old). Adds Kill-Icons]
//
// A new TF2C update calls for a new weapons pack update to match! Truthfully, though, this update sorta came out of nowhere a bit sooner than I expected, so sadly I don't have too much weapons-wise for ya. The ideas I do have are pretty experimental, though!
// But, hey, that's not all, at least! I wanted to take these weapons' authenticity up a level, so what better way than to FINALLY add killicons! Yep, that's right, new icons for everything I've made thus far! It took a bit of doing, but I think I figured out a pretty good way to make 'em in the style of TF2C!
// Paired with these backpack icons I've been doing, and more of my new material and model changes, I hope these push a little closer to being "TF2C quality", silly as my weapons may be! I was already goin' for that, but hopefully it feels even MORE authentic!! Okay, have fun, and kill lots and lots for me~!

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench that excels at upgrading things FAST, but has abysmal metal recovery. Also hits harder.]
//
// Another case of "bit-off-more-than-I-could-chew", it's the Eureka Effect! Originally, this was a wrench that "teleported" metal over to your buildings when hitting other people with it. It worked just about as well as that sounds it did.
// Unlike the S. Hospitality, though, this was in a... let's say, scuffed spot to recreate in TF2C. There's nothing else I can really even do that has any vague relation to "teleporting", so I had to hit the drawing board. I almost scrapped it.
// EVENTUALLY, I came up with a brief stopgap - recreating the wrench's ability to quickly get things built up near Spawn and then switching to another wrench! Scuffed, but it'll do until I can invent an AOE Repair-Pulse wrench or Radius Wrench or something...!

//
// I sorta just felt like adding a "Bottle-type" unlock, so the Scot. Handshake is back! It was simple enough, really, but I later decided I wanted to give it stats. Why? For funsies, mostly. I might later move this to its own weapon... but Demo's full on 'em right now.
// In essense, I wanted to recreate the ability to "top-up" your health by taunting and drinking, which you could do on some old Live TF2 comm. servers! In lieu of having no taunt-healing outside of the Kritzkrieg, though, I shifted to some experimental attribs.
// It came out... alright? Demoman gets more healing from most things, but has an achilles heel in the form of lighting on fire from Pyro (a leftover from that drink-heal phase), so it... maybe works? I think it's inoffensive for now, I might tweak it more!

It began as a reskin, later turning into an odd "less pellets higher damage" deal, and finally, to this iteration! You start with low-ish ammo, but incrementally get more and more with more kills!
// By default, it starts quite a bit weaker than the default Scattergun, but increases to a comical amount of ammo after just a few kills! Your low damage and slower reload is an ever-present facet of this weapon, though, so pick the right times to run in and unload one, two, three, four, and five shots into your unsuspecting enemies!

// Whack, thwack, smack! Cut loose and cut, hack, and slash your foes to pieces with the beloved kukri, the Bushwacka! This was a relatively early concept, but even when it started working, there was the problem of... figuring out how to balance it around NOWP's Sniper.
// See, he plays the same, but he has a LOT more tools at his disposal that apply MfD - and thus make this thing do full crits! It's a bit scary, and for the time being all I have (in addition to the old downsides) is a slower swing speed.
// It's... something? It's still scary, to be sure, but the swing speed is slow enough to put you in some danger using this. Cut your foes down, but be wary of them doing the exact same to you.

// [Comm. Contributors: Basil PFP / OCsonic, azzy (Thermal Thruster)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 32 Weapons! (14:18 New/Old). Adds texture mipmaps globally. Updates Kill-Icons to use hooks]
//
// Well, this has been a long time coming, but after so, so long, the Big Update is here! For NOWP, that is. While TF2C v2.1.0 takes its sweet time to appear, I think it really is due time I show y'all what I've been working on for this long...!!
// This is, by far, the biggest update I've ever made for any of my mods, by a LONG shot! Dozens of new weapons, too many balance changes, new responses, cleanup and polish all-around, and even more, all with the goal of making New-Old Weapons Pack the best it can possibly be! So, I really, really do hope that reflects in this update of a lifetime!
// That said... this update cycle sure has been something. Having worked on this for the better part of the year, I think this should be a good spot to leave the mod in for a bit. I hope you all enjoy, and blast eachother to smithereens! Just like I (and K.R. Fawkes) would have intended. Ehehe...

// Smack some sense into allies (figuratively), enemies (literally), and everything in-between (theoretically), with this odd take on the Hot Hand! Yes, the knockback is intentional~
// Admittedly, I just wanted to create this after the GMod SWEP of the same name, but eventually figured it should be a standard ol' knockback weapon, like the rest. Not much gained, not much lost. Ya do less damage, but you can send people off cliffs for (mostly) free! The good with the bad.
// This... may, at some point, get split? I believe we have enough that we can re-create the Hot Hand 1-1 to Live TF2's, it's just... it's not that much more compelling in there, either. I'll keep this as-is, unless something comes up!!

//
// Move over, regular Nailgun, your bigger, buffer, quad-barrelled brother has arrived... the Super Nailgun! Eager to make another new projectile-primary for Heavy, I thought, "Why not try out a Minigun that shoots a storm of nails?" It does just about as you'd expect it to, in that regard!
// That's not all it has going for it, though - nails, as a base property of theirs, have quite good damage even at mid-range, so this means that this minigun is unusually good at a slightly further out range than Heavy's usual fare! However, as of now, it only fires one nail per bullet, so damage may not be as scary as before. Maybe.
// It's also just a bit slower overall vs. the regular Minigun, so plan ahead whether you wanna totally cover a doorway, or be able to balance between reacting to threats and defending!

// [Overview: Engineer - A PDA that makes Dispensers and Teleporters build and act VERY fast, but with dramatically low defenses.]
//
// Hoo, this is a doozy. This PDA is, in short, a supercharged Gunslinger, or maybe a Mini-Buildings PDA as a whole. Just like how the Gunslinger deploys faster, weaker sentries, this is intended to deploy faster, weaker buildings in general.
// As one could guess due to this being, well, all of them at once, it effectively has three entire weapons' worth of internals to wrangle with!! As a result, though, it makes a hyper-offense focused Engineer toolkit. Build fast, think fast, move fast.
// This item... I'll be honest is likely to get instantly obliterated into like 2-3 sub-weapons come the removal of custom PDAs, which I'm not looking forward to, but is a reality that's getting closer!! Hoo boy!
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Dispensers and Teleporters build fast.
// Buildings have 127 HP (from 150). Buildings can't be upgraded. Dispenser + Teleporter cost 30% less metal to build (130 70 35)
// Dispenser generates surplus metal and do more healing. Teleporter builds as fast as a Jump Pad
// When combined with the split variant, Buildings have 82 HP (from 150), Build Cost is reduced, etc

// That aside, I had been toying previously with the idea of area landmines that acted more as deterrents or detection tools. So, in a strange twist of fate, this became a realization of that concept! A diet mine-layer for Engineer, essentially.

// Most of it remains the same, with you marking people as high-priority targets with a big skull over their head for you or your allies to take out with reckless abandon! But, with one key difference... you can mark multiple people for death at once.
// Because of this, the time for an individual mark is a lot lesser, and I thought it'd be a good idea to slow down switch-off speed too. Thusly, you'll want to mark 1-3 targets, dash away, and then swap back! After all, you're not going to be doing much damage with this alone. To victory!

// [Overview: Demoman - An Axe that hits... really, really hard.]
//
// The Skullcutter, everybody! There's really not much to be said about this weapon - it's unchanged one-eye over for a decade because it does its job, and does it well, with only two stats to its name. -234 DMG at a time.
// As far as its inclusion in NOWP goes, though, it mostly whittles down to two factors - I wanted to try to add more Demoman melees that aren't JUST swords, and Skullcutter is, funny. It's not tryin' to be, but it is. Gotta appreciate it for that~

// [Overview: Heavy - A Minigun that sacrifices your mobility and reaction time for sheer damage!]
//
// Don't got anywhere to go fast? Don't worry, you can make sure the enemy doesn't have anywhere to go fast, either... hold down the fort with this decidedly not-brass beast of a minigun as it shreds through hallways with devestating damage!
// Functionally, it just works as it did before... you are VERY, very slow with revving, but the damage from your minigun is potentially some of the scariest in the game! Paired with a dispenser, and / or a source of crits? The enemy may as well set up camp, they're not makin' it through alive.
// Given its properties, this is a surprisingly very defensive minigun, you'd mainly use this in places where you KNOW enemies are going to approach you; a perfect match for a defensive role! Although it's missing the extra damage resistance, too, I think it still works as such.

// Hey! I... wasn't expecting to be back so soon, but no rest for the wicked, I guess! In any case, I've already prepped a bunch of new weapons and a LOT, I mean a LOT of balance changes for y'all! Hopefully this... works?
// ...If I might be blunt, I think the fatigue is starting to set in, I hadn't really even gotten any real rest from last update before I needed to hurry back and push this update to fix the balancing. Which, might I remind you, I'm not stellar at!
// Well, I think THIS time, I've earned a solid break. Thus far I've made 7 entire updates for TF2C v2.0.0 and its patches... and I just want to take a breather for a while, until next update actually decides to release! Think of it as an extended summer vacation! Take a load off and spill some blood, hopefully I'll see y'all soon...!

// This was mostly spurred about as I realized, the crit-vs-cond attribute DOES happen to, mysteriously, have a bitflag for a few odd healing ones... including one for actively being healed right now! That got me thinking, and I eventually decided to try my hand at this!
// All said, though, it does have ONE downside, but it's a notable one; you do half as much damage. Simple upside, simple downside, but it means your average axe swings deal a measly 33 DMG, and 99 against a heal-target! So, make it count, and catch them off guard before they realize what's happening...

// [Overview: Pyro - A Flamethrower that rapid-fires projectiles to spread damage + afterburn across a wider area! See: Dragon's Fury, Flamethrower, Incendiary Cannon]
//
// A new challenger arrives on the Pyro Projectile-Launcher scene... it's the (former) Molotov Launcher! This weapon has had a... messy... history, but I think I'm finally happy with where it is currently, so we'll see if that stays.
// My initial ideas were to have it shoot Molotovs that provide a lingering AoE effect, but that... didn't really pan out. I don't think any of us really liked the 4-shot explosive molotovs, either, and it was just so bulky and... y'know what? Back to the drawing board!
// I figured for a rework of this, I wanted to focus more on it being a more general-purpose, faster, easier to use slant on the DF! Fast, low damage, decent splash, and otherwise no special effects. Simple, but feels and looks a lot better than before. We'll see if it needs more spice, soon...!

// I wanted to try expanding its niche as a "surprise pick" weapon, for once. Scout has the speed to surprise people and land a few key hits in, but almost never runs into burning enemies enough to justify this. So, I wanted to try expanding it;
// "If finding a player with any one of these is so rare, how about all of them at once?" - Scout is still unlikely to find a player with any of these, but the odd variety means you might be compelled to snag this for once, you certainly never know what'll happen!

// The whole "honorbound" system doesn't really work, so I made a facsimile by having it deduct health upfront and always switch pretty slowly off. Beside, the weapon is already fairly strong as-is - it heals HALF of your max HP even in Live!!
// I might work on this more, but it's highly unlikely that they'll add any of the specific mechanics for this... on the bright side, the 1hko mechanic works! YOU'RE the only one that deserves a katana around here, after all! Not those other SCHMUCKS.

To match with the monumental occassion of a NEW MAJOR UPDATE, I've assembled one of the biggest updates New-Old Weapons Pack has yet seen, with dozens of new weapons, restored function for old weapons, and so. So much polish. To make this maybe the single best version of NOWP yet!!
// I really can't understate how much of everything changed, everything I could think of to fix, simplify, and overhaul - I did so. I've been planning this update out from as soon as early 2021, even working concurrently with my earlier updates, and always having planned this to be a simple patch to add some goodies for TF2C v2.1.0!
// Well, evidently, things took a little longer than intended, and I had to roll some stuff back into NOWP v2.2.5. But, I think, this is it. The update, as I always meant it to be, is FINALLY OUT!! Paint the badlands red today, boys, you've earned it. Make us proud.

// [Overview: Demoman - A Shield with heavy focus on mobility, w/ weaker properties overall. Since ALL shields in TF2C do this, has 1-2 extra benefits!]
//
// Demoman finally gets a shield! This, initially, was intended to be the Chargin' Targe, but given how TF2C's shields work with their complete turn freedom, I didn't feel it was right to implement it as-is. So, instead of that, I added this!
// This shield existing should be a familiar baseline, although not identical to Live. It doesn't strictly have 'downsides', per-se, but here it acts somewhat as the "default" shield, in a similar role the C. Targe held originally. So, not much special going on.
// Since the charge turning is a property of ALL shields, as of writing, this has a faster recharge time to act as a more readily available mobility option that recharges somewhat fast!
//

// Stock Weapon for the purposes of other weapons. Not actually a stock weapon.

// This belonged to a weapon that I was testing for a fairly long time and was ALMOST confident in releasing, the Helicopter Gun. However, things didn't pan out... this entry's empty until I can figure something out.
// The basic gist, was that it applied very weak pushback force onto Heavy to allow him to hover in the air if he shoots directly downward. Offset by extremely low ammo, low dps, and extra fall damage (don't sleep on this it HURTS)
// However, despite my best efforts, there was too much weirdness with all sorts of things like explosives, Jump Pads, and even -water- making Heavy skyrocket into the Skybox. This wasn't something I think people would stomach dealing with...

// It's a little scuffed, but it works. Not too much else to say, ha... for what it is, it's just a semi-reliable way to get guaranteed crits. Hey, maybe even help out some afterburn-seeking classes like Pyro or Scout.

//
// Get those legs kickin'! Jump around like the floor is made of hot, radioactive, possibly sewage-infused lava with the Winger, an odd returning pistol that hasn't changed one eye over since its first day jumping out of the factory!
// Admittedly, I mostly made this out of a desire to have a more mobility-focused option for Scout, so I glanced at his arsenel, and there was this! Plus, they recently added gravity-modifiers to feign the jump height stuff, so I went with that! It just works out the real-deal jump modifiers came shortly after.
// Honestly, it's very odd how Scout's "mobility pistol" situation evolved. This weapon didn't even have any bonuses for that at all, yet the PBPP did, and then didn't! Ah, well. What works... works?

// [Overview: Engineer - A Wrench-thing that deploys fast-building, weaker sentries. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is the Gunslinger! It doesn't visually look like it is, but it will be later. This weapon emerged from very odd circumstances - the PDA: Rush Order was getting EXTREMELY crowded, and unfortunately, I had to split it.
// This effectively acts as one-half of it, and acts similarly to how the Live TF2 variant does - it deploys a faster-building and acting Sentry Gun! And has some other weird bonuses and negatives. It's very weird. I can't promise it'll get less weird...
// When the time comes - either be it the removal of custom PDAs or a way I can port the Gunslinger model in without looking fucked up - I'll most likely do even more things to this. Stay tuned...!?
//
// Other Notes:
// Makes Sentries build fast.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50)
// Sentry behaves a-la Mini Sentry in Live TF2 (faster firerate, turn rate, but less damage, knockback)
// When combined with the split variant, Buildings have 84 HP (from 150), Build Cost is reduced, etc

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v2.6.5 (Update 9, 5/29/2023)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
// [Comm. Contributors: Colrot (Loose Cannon)]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 3 Weapons! (1:2 New/Old). Adds item name colors]
//
// New patch, new update! Admittedly, I hadn't really had the time to start much of anything, I wasn't expecting a patch so soon!! But, in any case, a few new weapons join the pack, as well as a handful of quality improvements!
// Notably, new item qualities! I wanted to have a better way to distinguish between "new" and "old" weapons, so what better way than to use the newfangled system to define colors myself! "New" just uses the existing item color, but "Old" uses a more subtle version of the Live TF2 Unique color!

//
// That's right. It's a bucket! YOUR BUCKET! And by God, you'll make sure it explodes into firey bits before any enemies can lay their grabby lil' hands on it!
// Even from joke beginnings, I wanted to experiment both with a knockback throwable, as well as with that one attribute that makes pill-based stuff explode if you fire rockets at it! A bit awkward to convey, but I think I did well enough.
// In general, throw this at enemies, and wait for them to either forget about it so it blows up, or detonate it yourself for massive combined damage! Exactly the kind of stratagem Sun Tzu would have envisioned.

//
// Looks like those dime a' dozen backstabbin' scumbags are good for something, huh! Awful kind of the enemy Spy to lend you a hand... and an arm. I wanted to see how much I could get this weapon ported to TF2C, for fun, and as it turns out, quite a bit!
// It's originally a reskin, but I figured it'd be fun to give it stats. On a kill (which is already a decently big ask), the broken invis watch kicks in, and Scout gets a few moments of the incredibly-powerful Stealthed status, to either beat a hasty retreat, or run in and catch enemies unaware as he fires!
// However, you'll have very significant passive weaknesses to worry about - you're EXCEPTIONALLY weak to fire now, and the weapon switching and decloaking also take away a bit of your ability to react quickly to threats. Tag a kill if you can, and think fast whether to run in or out of combat! Show that dumbass how it's done.

// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (8:3 New/Old). Adds custom particles]
//
// It's the moment you've all been waiting for... for both TF2C, and NOWP! It was a long wait, but hopefully worth it - I started work on this update (and even the previous one, NOWP v2.6.5!) with anticipation for TF2C v2.1.2's features, and it's finally here!
// To start, I wanted to try making a lot of new, inventive weapons, this time - weapons I don't usually make variants for! On top of that, I wanted to really push QoL to the next level in a way I haven't done in some time. How? Well, new particles for EVERYTHING, new supplemental mods like dropped mags and shells, and more fixes than I can count!!
// It's been a while, but I really am happy with how this update turned out, despite everything. My goal has always been to make these silly things with a level of quality on-par with Eminoma / TF2C Team's own efforts for TF2C, and I think I'm just about there... finally... But, enough about me. Stop gawkin', and start killin'!

// Alongside the new weapons are even more QoL changes, like bloodied weapons on crit-kills, and FINALLY fixing that stupid Medigun beam bug after months of work (no thanks to a certain server), so hopefully NOWP will finally be... okay, hhh, look, I need to level with you for a moment.
// I'm so, so tired. It's thankless work, and having to play fix-up because somebody else can't be bothered to properly maintain their own work has been getting increasingly frustrating to me. I need a break, for a long time. I'll be back, don't worry, but I need some time. Take care, and have fun...!

// [Overview: Scout - A Melee that drops health on kill for you or your team's survivability!]
//
// Since a few convenient things worked out, like the stat for it working, the time of year being right, and me being upset at how AWFUL it looks in Live TF2, I decided I wanted to try my hand at bringing back the infamous Candy Cane, but with more than 5 minutes of work put in!
// The visuals have been tidied up, and importantly, the stats are back too, and even with a new twist! I felt the original candy cane was a bit boring, so I added a small overhealing-mechanic to it. A Scout can use this either to top himself up, or support his own team with many small healthkits dotting the battlefield. Merry Australian Smissmass!

// New-Old Weapons Pack! v3.0.0 (Update 12, 9/11/2024)
// [Creator(s): SilentFox3]
//-----
// [Update Log: Adds 11 Weapons! (9:2 New/Old)]
//
// Welcome back! I missed y'all, and this time I have the biggest update in, shoot, a while! All this time off meant I had a lot of time to reflect, but also a lot of time to put polish and effort into making these again! Not that I wasn't before, but I think you can tell the last few were a little bit rushed, haa...
// This time, everybody gets a new toy or gadget to play with, the QoL is as high as it's ever been, and the balancing! Well, I still suck at balancing, but I've made an effort to rebalance almost everything slightly! This update, for the first time in a long time, has a little bit of everything!
// I'm happy with it, I really am. But, I've gotten to thinking about the longevity of New-Old Weapons Pack, and I don't want it to grow forever like certain other projects. So, I think it's time I think about closure, soon...! But, not quite yet. So, while you still have little ol' me here, maim some people and make me happy!

// [Overview: Scout - A Lunchbox that grants extra damage to your attacks, but makes you vulnerable to attacks yourself!]
//
// It's like drinking straight from an electrical outlet in a nuclear reactor, it's the Crit a Cola! Guaranteed to make you feel 5000% manlier, with the frankly concerning amounts of testosterone and steroids that'll be flowing through your body! Women and men alike will swoon, and be taken to the hospital from your GOOD LOOKS!
// Hehe, all that said, I wanted to try making another Scout drink, first and foremost. I had ideas for a Speed Drink, and that may yet be a future thing, but I wanted to try maybe tackling another old weapon first, after all, it suited my needs.
// It does more damage with mini-crit boosts! But, there's a catch. While I can't also make Scout vulnerable during that same time period... yet, he'll take more damage from any crit, which includes the minicrits he'll take from melees! You might live, but land your blows well, or else it's lights out for good.

// While, as a pattern, I tend to bring back the older, stronger variants of Live weapons if possible, I decided to stick with the new one, this time, if only because Demoman in NOWP already has... so, so many does-damage-good type GL's.
// Figured out none of them, for their damage capabilities, really are incredible at dealing with buildings on their own, so I decided to bring this back! And fix some longstanding bugs, as usual, hehe.

// I'm sure it's no surprise they were testing a Spy Radar - the existence of the aptly-named "sapper is radar" attribute is proof enough! And, while I'm sure several iterations of it existing using this stat, I wanted to try a more direct approach.
// One small issue I have with the single stat, is that the outlines are only really visible to the Spy, so his usage of it is only as good as the person is at conveying information. Some people don't use voice chat, or text, so it'd be really useless there!
// I wanted to sidestep the issue, while also making it more familiar to how Sappers usually work (with a LOT, I mean a LOT of elbow grease!!) - and the result? I think, a semi-servicable gadget - just sap people the same way you do Buildings, and apply outlines that way!

// I was torn between wanting to make something more support-oriented vs. movement oriented... but settled why not a little bit of both! Since Sniper already has such a powerful tool with Jarate, I figured I'd supplement it with a new jar that has more utility for tracking, or for your teammates to use!
// There... is more work to be done, but I think it should suffice for the time being. I may shift around exact properties semi-often, so keep an eye on this! Not too closely, though, it's caustic. Wait, what do you mean you didn't bring gloves or goggles??

// I felt inspired, by Engineer's buildings also having miniguns, a variety of mods existing to give Heavy some, and an old quote, to bring this to life. To quote a veteran member of our own GRN team; "Congratulations! You are now my new Sentry."
// All said, though, it's a very loose imagining of it, with some influence from the Wrangler, TF2C B4's increasing-firerate chaingun, and some scrapped ideas of mine, it's a Minigun that situationally fires faster if you're at low health! At full health, it's not much better at all vs. Stock,
// but when the going gets tough, you bet your enemies will all but explode into gibs! But, so will you, if you aren't careful. Paired with your very volatile ammo situation, plan ahead and throw yourself into combat in close quarters, maybe you'll do Engineer proud and walk away with some kills under your belt!

//
// Do you hear those ominous bells tolling? Eh, probably nothing to worry about -- look, it's another update! The second to last! I was debating whether or not to just put everything into my last-last update, later this year, but decided I wanted to accompany a TF2C major update, just one more time. Once more, for the road, a minor update!
// Another patch, another set of new toys for ya. Admittedly, I was hoping to make more for this middle-update, but I just need more time and content for the remainder of my ideas! But, you'll see the last of my big ideas, with any luck, soon enough. Hang in there, we're almost done...! Until then, I'll knuckle down for y'all, and get a-crackin' for a last update y'all deserve and can be happy with!
// And, until then, I'll... think about what I want to do after. Even now, I don't want to entirely give up, but I'm determined next time will be the last major update with y'all. Maybe, just maybe, I'll release smaller patches onto it. Small surprises to accompany my completed masterwork... ehe... one can dream. But, otherwise... ciao, for now. 'Till we meet again... friends. See you soon.

// As it turns out, just ONE weapon type works for my purposes, and that also has a shield mechanic, so I thought - instead of completely ignoring that, how about we use every part of this beefy business and see where we end up!?

// May have guessed it, but this originally started life as an Iron Bomber rework. See, the IB has a stat that makes its pipes essentially stop moving once it hits the ground. That's an incredibly cool and unique feature, and one some people make use of - but not many, sadly. A lot of people tend to just use the IB like Stock, with different properties, and completely forget or forego the entire gimmick there.
// I wanted to really try making a GL that actually, really focuses in on those stationary pipebombs, since IB doesn't really use it in a meaningful way. The result? An odd lil' hybrid between the GL and SBL - fire on congested areas or cover your escape, and your bombs explode with a fair delay in the exact spot you laid them! Your enemies and allies alike will scratch their heads figuring out what is and isn't a pipebomb, anymore!

// [Overview: Medic - A Syringegun that has high single-shot burst damage, and can even heal! More room for enemy counterattack, though... See: Nurnberg 'Nader]
//
// Who said giant, bone-piercing arrows can't be medicinal!? Prove your allies wrong and your enemies right, with the grand return of the classic medicinal crossbow! "Now with actual healing!"
// For quite a long time, this just focused on damage. Re-creating the basic functions of the Crossbow is easy enough, I've even done it 3 times to date. The tricker part is the details, like the inverted rampup, which also returns.
// And finally, the healing is back! But, toned down significantly... I don't want this to completely outshine any other Syringe Gun AGAIN, so it only ever heals up to 45 HP. A great asset, but hopefully think about the others...!

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL for comboing by aiming well to keep the damage comin'! See: B4 Cyclops, Pillstreak concept]
//
// Initially drafted by Kris, this weapon went through quite many iterations, before I settled on something that, surprisingly, worked! In its current iteration, this takes some scrapped TF2C concepts and turns it into a single weapon!
// The "combo" mechanic was, admittedly, a huge pain to figure out, but I remain startled at how well it works! I still have work to do on this thing yet - especially if they add either of the two scrapped concept weapons it's based on, finally, but for now, this should do!
// Despite the original prerelease Cyclops in TF2C being a little flat, I think this gives it a bit of identity! Big rewards, but upkeep issues if you can't consistently land hits.

// [Overview: Engineer - An arm augmentation that increases mobility by flinging yourself forward when you punch, and minicrits with successive hits. Also slightly lowers building health and raises your own. See: Gunslinger (duh), TF2C PDQ]
//
// A very odd weapon in all aspects, this is *a* Gunslinger! Instead of just buffing your health and providing a mini combat sentry, it instead buffs your health, provides extra mobility, and more damage with multiple hits in a row, at the cost of weaker and level limited buildings. This'll let you get a sentry up in a spot you wouldn't normally be able to, 
// but don't expect to be able to maintain it against direct fire! Could also be useful for retreating, or being a real gun slinger and being right up in the fray!
// The Sentry does less damage, but not as less as the PDQ or Gunslinger.
//
// Other Notes:
// Punching people sets them on fire for a second, the afterburn doesn't deal any damage. Hitting burning targets does minicrit damage. This was done to somewhat replicate Live TF2's Gunslinger's niche but unique 3-hit combo mechanic.
// Upgrading is slowed down by a bit. You only get to spend 20 metal instead of 25, meaning you have to hit a building 10 times to upgrade it, down from the 8 times wit the Stock Wrench.
// Buildings have 97 HP (from 150). Buildings can be upgraded to Level 2 (116 HP, from 180). Sentries cost less to build (130 100 50). It doesn't give you a mini-sentry tho.
// When combined with the jump pad, you get to absolutely FLY across maps!
// You'll take minicrits from projectiles while in the air, so watch out for that!

// Another old classic returns for another spin on the block, it's the Backburner! Not much to say, it works about as you'd expect. It has the crits from behind and increased airblast cost, but with a few tweaks! The crits from behind are now minicrits, the airblast isn't as expensive, airblasting knocks yourself backwards for some mobility, and aiblasting projectiles causes them to fizzle out of existence instead of reflecting them.

// [Overview: Demoman - An interpretation of the Half Life 1 Satchel charge, or well a SBL that launches detonatable MIRVs.]
//
// Take the best parts of the SBL, Dynamite Pack, and Minelayer, and smash them together, and you get this! Multiple throwable mirvs, limited to 4 active at once, manually detonated, but without the fragmentation aspect.
// This one was quite fun to make, and I hope to god it's not unbalanced.

// Are you happy with the Überspritze, but just wish it could "cut" it a bit more? Maybe if it "saw" a bit of a different future, it might be a more dangerous-looking weapon? Or, do you just really, really want to inject people while still using a Bonesaw?
// Well, you're in luck! A mixup at the Bonesaw Factory and the Syringe Factory created a somehow-familiar looking weapon... a fearsome looking saw with a blade and syringe to match, we'll call it... "The Übersaw". And it could be yours, for a low, low payment of $4.99!
// (Okay, for a serious summary - I just like the old Übersaw, and wanted to have it back. It has the old stats, if you want those! But, it makes little difference, an übersaw's an überspritze's an über-weapon! Saw through their bones like it's 2008!)

// Originally, it was some sort of "Minigun" with a much more limited clipsize that shot explosives of... some, kind. Heavy can also blast jump with it by default! So, that's cool! I decided to fold all of these into my new iteration of it, so hopefully it's fun to mess with!
// To my surprise... they decided to finally, actually re-visit the AAGun idea, and officially released it the next update! So, not wanting to totally remove this, I gave this an honorary Vintage quality, and reworked it to be a might faster-firing variant! Complete with blast jump... it's important to the LORE.

// [Overview: Demoman - A GL for consistency, with centered projectiles. Also has cool bounce noises! See: Original]
//
// I thought it to be thematically appropriate to finally give Demoman an Original-like! So, not to let Soldier have all the fun, Demoman also gets a Quake weapon! Not much to say, really, it's simplicity itself.
// I am really proud of how the viz turned out for this weapon, though! I tried my best to mimic the Original's aesthetics with both the model and sounds, and think it turned out well! I love the Quake GL bounces. And hey, those use trickery to work~
// Only qualm is, the animations in thirdperson are weird. But, whateverrrr...

//-----
// It's no secret that this kind of weapon is really underwhelming, KOCW had this kind of weapon, and only ever saw use when engineer stacking after they introduced an engineer cap there, 
// and it kind of sucked at actually keeping a nest up. Which of course, made it get complained about enough to get nerfed into the ground. This is KOCW we're talking about here. (Eternal skill issue)
// Albiet, maybe it's more useful in VIP mode, but I highly doubt that. Plus, ultimately, it just makes an already overly passive class even more passive.
// So, I thought, what if I let this have some kind of buff? Well, traditional buffs are a bit out of the question, due to how weird that'd be to implement.
// But, I thought that this getting a version of engie's ether spell could be a really good way to make this a lot better and more practical.
// There's no other civ weapons that can give ammo after all. That's  an interesting thing for him to be able to do, and leans into the concept at play here.
// So ya, hopefully this will end up make this more vertsatile, powerful, and interesting. -Clock

// Here's a fun fact. The max possible Weapon ID is 32767; Half of 65535, minus one! Any higher will corrupt your loadout screen.
// If every other person in the entire TF Community made their own weapon, we'd be able to see this legit! Or just set the ID to 32768. Y'know.
