# The-Inventorium
A TF2C modpack run on the server of the same name.

<br>If you have any questions, suggestions, complaint, bug reports, or whatever else, contact IAmTheOneWhoStoleYourClock on discord (@clockstealer), make an issue here, or talk about it on the discord server at https://discord.gg/eAh63UtMuz.
<br>The assets are not included here ftm. Download them here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E6ZhlzZZ4oav7bxxknbI9COS0sGJsHk5/view?usp=drive_link 
<br>To run these privately, take the assets, put them in a new folder inside your custom folder, then take the text files ending with items_game.txt, and put them into your maps folder.
<br>Sourcemods shouldn't be required for everything but engineer unfortunately needs them for some bug fixes and two of his weapon's functionalities.
<br>(For a guide on how to install sourcemod, see https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_sourcemod. Then place the plugins in the plugin folder. The scripting files aren't nessesary to run the plugins)
<br>This modpack does not natively support 4team. It will still run fine, but some cosmetics/weapons won't be the correct team colour/have error textures. Also i'm pretty sure the building plugin won't work.
<br>The unmodified modpacks included can be found here:
<br>New-Old Weapons Pack!: https://gamebanana.com/mods/40389
<br>Mannly Munitions: https://gamebanana.com/mods/415275
<br>Codename: reVALVe: https://gamebanana.com/mods/534107
<br>Mombae's Fun Pack ᗜˬᗜ: https://gamebanana.com/mods/416688 (Note that this one will not work without some modifications, as it has not been updated in a while)
<br>Model credits can be found there, and in the item schema where applicable.
<br>Note that you will need to manually rename medieval_items_game.txt and vip_maps_items_game.txt to whatever vip and medieval maps you have installed if testing privately. (ex. cp_degrootkeep_items_game.txt)
<br>The mod is currently no longer slated to recieve non bugfix updates.
