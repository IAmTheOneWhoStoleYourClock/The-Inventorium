# The-Inventorium
A TF2C modpack run on the server of the same name.

If you have any questions suggestions or whatever else, contact me on discord (@clockstealer), or make an issue here.
To run these privately, Take the assests, put them in a new folder inside your custom folder, and then take the map folder, and it into your maps folder.
For use for the server only, just paste the files into your downloads folder.
Note that this modpack does not natively support 4team (except on dom_krepost)
