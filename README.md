# The-Inventorium
A TF2C modpack run on the server of the same name.

<br>If you have any questions suggestions or whatever else, contact me on discord (@clockstealer), or make an issue here.
<br>To run these privately, take the assests, put them in a new folder inside your custom folder, then take the map folder, and it into your maps folder.
<br>For use for the server only, just paste the files into your downloads folder.
<br>Note that this modpack does not natively support 4team (except on dom_krepost)
