# The-Inventorium
A TF2C modpack run on the server of the same name.

<br>If you have any questions suggestions or whatever else, contact me on discord (@clockstealer), or make an issue here.
<br>To run these privately, take the assests, put them in a new folder inside your custom folder, then take the text files ending with items_game.txt, and put them into your maps folder.
<br>For use for the server only, just paste those files (Excluding LICENSE.txt and README.md) into your downloads folder.
<br>Note that this modpack does not natively support 4team for the time being. (Except on medieval maps)
<br>The unmodified modpacks included can be found here:
<br>New-Old Weapons Pack!: https://gamebanana.com/mods/40389
<br>Mannly Munitions: https://gamebanana.com/mods/415275
<br>Codename: reVALVe: https://gamebanana.com/mods/534107
<br>Mombae's Fun Pack ᗜˬᗜ: https://gamebanana.com/mods/416688 (Note that this one will not work without some modifications, as it has not been updated in a while)
<br>Model credits can be found there.
<br>Note that you will need to manually rename medieval_items_game.txt and vip_maps_items_game.txt to whatever vip and medieval maps you have installed if testing privately. (ex. cp_degrootkeep_items_game.txt)
